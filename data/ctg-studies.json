This app is being developed to help people with schizophrenia manage their negative symptoms.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to gather new information on CT-155. Researchers want to see how well it works, how well participants use the study app, and how it affects the use of health care services.\n\nParticipants use the app for 16 weeks. They may continue using it for another 16 weeks. During the study, participants continue with their normal treatment for schizophrenia. Participants are in the study for about a year. During this time, they visit the study site every 2 months.\n\nDuring this study, doctors regularly check participants' schizophrenia symptoms and overall quality of life. Researchers may also compare the healthcare data of study participants with a similar group of people with schizophrenia who are not part of the study. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects."

        "briefSummary": "Chronic shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal pain condition that can have a profound impact on a sufferer's life and a large socioeconomic healthcare burden to society. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of delivering telemedicine enabled functional shoulder rehabilitation for chronic shoulder pain patients using immersive virtual reality. Ten chronic shoulder pain patients were recruited from local pain clinics. Patients engaged in three sessions of virtual embodiment training per week over the course of eight weeks. Rehabilitation sessions were delivered on an Oculus Quest head-mounted display and hand controllers. Rehabilitation exercises (virtual embodiment training) leverage techniques from graded motor imagery, such as visual mirror feedback and augmentation of the virtual avatar's movements. Eight pain assessments were administered prior to the first session, and at weeks four and eight to get an indication of the effect that telemedicine delivered virtual embodiment training has on symptoms of chronic shoulder pain.",
        "detailedDescription": "This study protocol was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by ADVARRA, an independent institutional review board. Ten chronic shoulder pain patients (7 Female, 3 Male, mean age = 48.44 years) provided written informed consent prior to participating in the study. Eight patients presented with chronic pain of the left shoulder and two presented with right chronic shoulder pain. Patients were recruited from a local pain clinic. Patients were excluded if they reported a history of motion sickness, a history of seizures, or cognitive impairments. A total of twenty-one patients were assessed for eligibility. Two patients were excluded prior to participation for a history of vertigo or motion sickness, and one was excluded due to color blindness. Four patients declined to participate prior to beginning treatment. Four patients were excluded due to impending surgeries scheduled that would prevent them from completing the study protocol (see Figure 1 consort diagram).\n\nPatients who volunteered to participate in the study were shipped an Oculus Quest six-degrees-of-freedom wireless head mounted VR display (HMD) and hand controllers. Patients were assigned a health coach to assist with the use of the VR hardware. The health coach met with the patients via a HIPAA compliant telehealth video chat platform. Patients were instructed on safe use of the VR headset and hand controllers and instructed on how to create the safe play guardian of the Oculus Quest VR system and how to connect the HMD to a home wi-fi. After the patients confirmed that they were comfortable using the Oculus Quest, they were advised to complete three sessions of functional rehabilitation in VR exercises per week over the course of eight weeks. All function rehabilitation exercises were self-administered by each patient. The coach conducted telehealth video chat sessions with each patient once per week and administered a structured curriculum that included pain neuroscience education, goal setting, instructions for pacing and grading, and flare-up management.\n\nFunctional rehabilitation exercises were delivered through KarunaHOME (Karuna Labs, Inc, San Francisco, CA). KarunaHOME is a virtual reality software delivered on the oculus quest to provide rehabilitation exercises in patient's homes. KarunaHOME Virtual Embodiment Trainingâ„¢ consists of five functional rehabilitation exercises designed on the principles of graded exposure and mirror therapy.\n\nEach session of functional rehabilitation began with a calibration exercise that measured shoulder range of motion for flexion, scaption, and abduction (Figure 2). The calibration exercise progressed through shoulder flexion, shoulder scaption, and shoulder abduction one at a time, on each side. The patient was instructed in VR to perform three repetitions within a comfortable range. The calibration exercise was a measurement of a patient's comfortable range of motion for flexion, scaption, and abduction and was used to set the limits of subsequent exercises so that patient did not move beyond their comfortable range during that day's session. The second exercise was a functional movement exercise that promoted shoulder flexion, scaption, and abduction while engaged in a reach and grasp task. Patients reached for an orb in the form of a floating lotus flower positioned in front of the patient in the virtual environment. Patients grasped the orb by moving the hand controller, which corresponded to movement of the virtual avatar's arm, and then pulled the trigger of the Oculus Quest hand controller using the index finger to toss the orb into a pond by producing either an overhand or underhand throwing motion and releasing the trigger. The second exercise also incorporated a mirror visual feedback (MVF) manipulation where the avatar's contralateral limb moved relative to the patient's movement. For example, if the patient moved their right arm, they would see embodied avatar's left arm moving. MVF was used for half the duration of each exercise. The third exercise was a reach and grasp exercise where patients reached to grasp colorful flowers by moving the hand controller to position the virtual avatar's arm in front of their embodied virtual avatar. The goal of this exercise was to match flowers of the same color in sets of three or more. The patient reached up for a flower to remove it and then the flowers above will fall into place. The exercise required patients to reach a maximum height by continuing to remove flowers. The fourth exercise was a painting exercise designed to promote complex dynamic shoulder motion. The goal of this exercise was to connect numbered dots by using the hand controller to move the virtual avatar's arm in a dynamic pattern to recreate different shapes in the sky using a virtual paintbrush. The first few shapes were directly in front of the patient and were simple movements such as a circle, triangle, heart. The shapes became progressively more difficult, requiring greater shoulder range of motion for reaching above and to the side, and progressed to more complex shapes to connect. The final exercise was a simulated activity of daily living in the form of a bow and arrow experience. Movements were designed to mimic motions that are included in activities of daily living such as putting on a seatbelt or shampooing hair. There were three distinct exercises within the bow and arrow activity. In all exercises, the patient moved the hand controller to move the virtual avatar's upper extremity limbs in a position that was necessary to complete the task. The first exercise required patients to reach the affected arm across body (horizontal adduction) to the quiver on the opposite hip to grasp an arrow and then bring the arrow to the bow (shoulder flexion) and pull back (scapular retraction) and shoot towards a target. The second exercise required patients to reach with affected arm over and behind the opposite shoulder to the quiver to get an arrow and then bring the arrow to the bow (shoulder flexion) and pull back (scapular retraction) and shoot. The third exercise required patients to reach over the affected shoulder (shoulder flexion, abduction, and internal and external rotation). Each session progressed from the first exercise to the last exercise with one minute of a guided breathing exercise in between each exercise. Patients completed three sessions per week over the course of eight weeks.\n\nTelehealth-based pain education and behavioral health coaching was administered once per week. The first session was ninety minutes in duration and consisted of a general introduction, a tutorial on safely using the VR hardware in the home, and general introductions to Virtual Embodiment Training. Sessions two through eight were sixty minutes in duration with each session addressing topics that could be applied in the virtual embodiment exercises as well as activities of daily living. Each session included discussions of goals to work towards, including goals within virtual embodiment exercises. Sessions also contained pain neuroscience education, instruction on graded exposure, and behavioral exercises designed to help patients cope with their chronic pain and manage stress with relaxation, awareness of emotions and pain-related thoughts, mindfulness and gratitude-based exercises.Patients were encouraged to apply what they learned in the behavioral coaching sessions in exercised performed in VR.\n\nThe primary objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of a home-based functional rehabilitation program delivered in VR combined with telehealth-based education and coaching. The secondary objective was to determine appropriate outcome measures for an eventual larger scale randomized controlled trial. To assess the potential effectiveness of VR telehealth delivered functional rehabilitation, a battery of pain assessments were administered at three timepoints (pre, mid, and post), prior to beginning the eight week protocol, at the midpoint (week 4), and after completing the eight week protocol. The Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire was used to assess shoulder disability. The SF-36 was used to assess was administered to assess quality of life. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) was used to assess psychological aspects of pain. The Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) physical activity subscale was used to assess fear of movement due to chronic pain. The Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) was used to assess shoulder function. The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) was used to assess fear of movement. The Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) was used to assess patient confidence. The Yellow Flag Risk Form (YFRF) was used to assess chronic pain mechanisms. Since this was a feasibility study, additional measures were assessed to determine appropriate outcome measures for an eventual larger randomized controlled trial."

Trial visits will be conducted remotely either by video visit or telephone. The screening visit may be performed in person at the discretion of the investigator. Eligible participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 digital therapeutics within a mobile application that will reside on the participant's personal iPhone or smartphone.\n\nThe trial population will include male and female participants between 22 and 64 years of age with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) who are on an ADT for the treatment of depression. This trial will analyze data gathered from approximately 360 participants in the United States. An interim analysis will be conducted when a targeted sample of the first 180 participants has completed week 6 or discontinued the trial prior to week 6."

Participants will be recruited from the University of Vermont Medical Center adult Pulmonary Clinic, Internal Medicine Clinic, and from the greater community via flyers and referrals, as needed. The primary outcome of interest will be the feasibility and acceptability of a remote digital therapeutic exercise program using a mobile application, called Vitala. Vitala is a FDA Registered, HIPAA Compliant CE-marked MDR class 1 medical device developed by doctors and physiotherapists. It is a mobile application tool that enables health care providers to prescribe and monitor diagnosis-specific exercise prescriptions that allows patients to remotely access their tailored therapeutic exercise program. URL: Medical exercise and digital rehabilitation - Vitala\n\nFeasibility and acceptability will be defined as â‰¥60% of subjects enrolled in the exercise program completing, on average, â‰¥50% (â‰¥75 minutes/ week) of the digital exercise program during their 12-week period, respectively. The secondary outcome of interest will be the efficacy of a remote digital therapeutic exercise program in participants with obesity and poorly controlled asthma by comparing asthma symptoms before, during, and at the end of the intervention. Efficacy will be defined as â‰¥30% of subjects who achieving a minimal clinically important difference in Asthma Control Test scores (defined as increase of â‰¥3 points\\[31\\]).\n\nThe Investigators plan to enroll participants on a rolling basis. Prospective participants will be contacted by phone, mail, or e-mail to establish interest and eligibility in the study. Once confirmed interested and eligible to participate in the study, they will be scheduled for eConsent and enrollment in the study (V0). Participants will receive a tailored exercise prescription unique to their individual needs, space, and available equipment and will be encouraged to complete 150 minutes of activity per week via their customized exercise program through the Vitala platform remotely for 12 weeks. Participants will be contacted when the program has been made available to them for program start, which will also be guided based on the participant's availability and preferred program start date (P0). During the 12 week exercise program, participants will have 3 remote contacts/visits (RC, V1, and 2), approximately every 4 - 6 weeks, over the 12 week intervention period including a final remote visit (V2) after completion of the program to assess adherence to the program, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life."

Many physicians are now implementing this strategy but the time it takes to educate patients on nutrition is a barrier. The research team is working with physicians to develop a solution whereby the nutrition education and intervention is delivered via mobile/online technology (i.e., an app). This study will test whether it is feasible and efficacious for physicians to recommend this app to their patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes to help them lose weight and improve their condition.",
        "detailedDescription": "The study is a non-experimental feasibility study to explore the acceptability, practicality and demand for the use of a 12-week, personalized, online program to teach and coach patients about therapeutic carbohydrate restriction for individuals with obesity and/or at risk for type 2 diabetes/with type 2 diabetes. The program is intended to enhance the usual clinical care provided for patients with these conditions and will allow for physicians to monitor patient progress through the program. Both physician and patient perspectives will be explored."

The main aims are to assess whether the Habitual Remission Programme (digital therapeutics + 12-week 800kcal/day low-energy diet, delivered remotely) is more likely to lead to weight loss and remission in adults with type 2 diabetes, when compared to standard of care.",
        "detailedDescription": "Participants will be randomly allocated to the Habitual Programme or standard care as delivered by the National Health Service (NHS). They will take a home blood test for HbA1c at baseline, 3 months and 6 months, and complete online fortnightly surveys to record their weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, side-effects and any changes in medication, for 6 months. These measurements will be taken at 6 months and 12 months after finishing the intervention for those allocated to the intervention.\n\nParticipants will be recruited from General Practitioner (GP) surgeries in England, managed by Lindus Health. Research Nurses at Lindus Health will complete screening and informed consent procedures."

        "briefSummary": "This project extends successful Phase I work that developed a Continuing Care mobile application (app) for probationers and parolees with SUDs who are at elevated risk of relapse, re-arrest, and incarceration. This Phase II STTR project will finalize app development and evaluate its efficacy in a randomized controlled trial. The project has high public health significance due to its potential to provide an accessible recovery support tool for individuals on probation or parole that could improve their substance use disorder treatment outcomes.",
        "detailedDescription": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) continue to be one of the most serious public health problems in the US. Studies have consistently documented a substantially higher prevalence of SUDs among adults under criminal justice supervision in the community (i.e., probation or parole) as compared to the general population. There is growing recognition that addiction is a chronic health condition, and individuals with SUDs typically cycle through multiple periods of treatment, abstinence, and relapse over several years to achieve and maintain recovery. Studies show that continuing care interventions can provide ongoing support or extend primary treatment gains with respect to reducing substance use, relapse, and criminal activity. Recent diffusion of Internet and smartphone technologies among disadvantaged populations now offers unprecedented opportunities for increasing access to quality continuing care interventions as well as chronic disease self-management tools. Probationers and parolees at high risk for drug abuse relapse and involvement in health compromising behaviors are an important population that stands to benefit from continuing care technologies. However, to date, no such technologies exist that are specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of this high-risk population.\n\nBuilding on our team's extensive experience in the fields of criminology and substance use, we propose to complete the development of a Continuing Care mobile application (app) and conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess efficacy among clients on probation or parole who are enrolled in outpatient substance use treatment. The app is designed to meet the recovery and personal support needs of probationers and parolees with SUDs who are at elevated risk of relapse, re-arrest, and incarceration. It is guided by the principles of the transtheoretical model of behavior change and app content is derived from the Your Own Reintegration System (YOURS) program, an empirically-supported16 intervention that focuses on substance use recovery, reducing criminal thinking and behavior, and managing and building support systems. If proven to be efficacious, the app could be deployed across the national network of outpatient treatment providers, and be highly significant in its direct impact on public health."

The test was designed to provide an ordinal measure of nicotine dependence related to cigarette smoking. In scoring the Fagerstrom Nicotine Dependency Test, yes/no items are scored from 0 to 1 and multiple-choice items are scored from 0 to 3. The items are added to yield a total score of 0-10. The higher total Fagerstrom score indicates a more intense/ higher dependency to nicotine (Heatherton, et. al, 1991)",

The intervention arm will test a mobile app that aims to help people reduce pain interference who have chronic pain, as well as mental health issues with depression and anxiety.

Participants will be treated with standard of care (SoC) in combination with the digital programs, or SoC only.\n\nWe will compare the effect of the digital programs in addition to SoC to SoC only, on the cancer-related quality of life (QoL), cancer-related fatigue, and side-effect management.",
        "detailedDescription": "In line with the growing need to support cancer patients with lifestyle modifications, education and disease management, Sidekick Health developed 14-week digital programs addressing the specific needs of patients with cancers. In this study, the effect of adding the Sidekick's digital program to the standard of care (SoC) treatment for cancer patients will be assessed, with focus on prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer. The digital programs investigated are a general oncology program (SK-411), or specific programs tailored for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PC-SK-451), colorectal cancer (CRC-SK-441), or lung cancer (LC-SK-431).\n\nThe study will be a single center feasibility study with an intervention group and a comparison group recruiting 84 cancer patients in active cancer treatment from LandspÃ­tali University Hospital. Patients will be randomized to receive either the SoC treatment alone or SoC with the addition of the digital program. Active cancer treatment is defined as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy according to standard treatment guidelines."

        "detailedDescription": "In this prospective randomized clinical study, obese adults with insulin resistance, prediabetes or diabetes mellitus type 2, patients of the Department of Exercise Medicine and Cardiovascular Rehabilitation at the University Hospital Olomouc, are randomized to receive either Vitadio or a conventional 6-month high-intensity lifestyle intervention program at the clinic.\n\nVitadio is a mobile application delivering behavioral change program focused on lifestyle change and self-management. The program aims for strengthening patients autonomy with the goal to promote weight loss and improve metabolic health. The program includes personalized education, adaptive daily tasks and weekly goals, automated motivational and educational messaging, monitoring tools, recipes, peer-support group and one-on-one remote coaching. Personalization of the intervention is achieved by analyzing participant's interactions with the application.\n\nThe conventional therapy consists of 5 face-to-face nutrition/lifestyle education sessions (at baseline, at 1st, 2nd and 3rd month, and at month 6). Participants in the control group can use an online diary tool for recording meals with an option to receive remote feedback on their diet from the educator. In addition, all participants undergo a regular medical assessment at the clinic (baseline, month 3, month 6).\n\nThe aim of the study is to assess feasibility and efficacy of digitally administered intervention by comparing evolution of weight, physical fitness, laboratory measures of metabolic health, blood pressure and other outcomes."

The study will examine if changing the application's delivery format and enhancing clinical content affects how patients use and interact with the intervention.\n\nProspective participants will complete a short screening assessment and if eligible complete informed consent procedures at the beginning of the Baseline visit. Qualifying participants will attend weekly virtual study visits during the 8-week treatment period.\n\nIn addition to weekly assessments, additional assessments will be administered at week 4 and week 8. Participants will be asked to complete a follow-up assessment 4 weeks after completing treatment."

        "briefSummary": "This will be a prospective multi-center controlled trial of 100 patients conducted to assess the real-world effectiveness of a mobile-delivered, prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) device delivering Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia using a novel patient-centered data-sharing platform with linkage to Fitbit for 61 weeks",
        "detailedDescription": "This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial to assess the real-world effectiveness of a mobile-delivered, prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) device delivering Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (i.e., Somryst, herein called PEAR-003b) using a novel patient-centered data sharing platform (called Hugo), with linkage to Fitbit (Inspire 2), among 100 patients with chronic insomnia. Half of the patients with insomnia will receive the PEAR-003b digital therapeutic with linkage to the Hugo platform and Fitbit (Inspire 2) and half of the patients with insomnia will not receive the PDT but will receive a Fitbit and be enrolled in the Hugo platform. The treatment duration will be 9 weeks with a 21-, 35-, and 61-week follow-up. All patients will be evaluated at baseline, as well as prompted to complete additional assessments at weeks 9, 21, 35, and 61. The PEAR-003b intervention will deliver CBT-I via mobile devices as 6 treatment core modules over 9 weeks. Additionally, the Hugo platform will be used to collect patient-generated engagement data, healthcare utilization outcomes, and patient activity/clinical outcomes. These real-world data points and trends collected as part of this pilot investigation will help inform a future larger healthcare effectiveness and outcomes research study."

        "briefSummary": "This clinical trial evaluates a smartphone application (app) called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on Vaping for helping young adults quit using electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). E-cigarettes pose numerous risks, particularly to youth and young adults. Addressing the high prevalence of e-cigarette use by young adults requires effective and accessible treatments to support current users to quit. Research shows this group prefers and benefits from newer methods of treatment delivery such as digital interventions. ACT on Vaping is a digital therapeutic intended to deliver behavioral therapy to young adults who vape to motivate and support abstinence from all nicotine and tobacco products. The app contains sessions that promote awareness of cues that trigger tobacco use and teach skills for responding to these triggers in a way that is tailored for the participant's readiness to quit. Receiving access to the ACT on Vaping app may be effective in helping young adults quit vaping.",
        "detailedDescription": "OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Participants use the ACT on Vaping app (Version A) and receive a text messaging program to motivate and support quitting. Participants also receive incentivized text message check-ins at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4 months to assess their vaping status.\n\nARM II: Participants use the ACT on Vaping app (Version B) and receive incentivized text message check-ins at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4 months to assess their vaping status.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, participants are followed up at 3 and 6 months."

        "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention delivered on a smartphone. This study examines whether this intervention might improve treatment outcomes for people with substance use disorders. The intervention, called LaddrÂ®, is a smartphone application (\"app\") that provides information and skills that can help people stop using substances. The social version of LaddrÂ® being tested in this study has new features that allow people in treatment for substance use disorders to include a support person in their treatment journey, including a friend, family member, or other acquaintance. This research study will compare the effectiveness of LaddrÂ® in combination with standard outpatient substance use treatment to standard treatment only for substance use disorders.",
        "detailedDescription": "Digital therapeutics, or software used to prevent, treat, or manage a medical disorder or disease, are redefining the future of healthcare by providing on-demand access to state-of-the-science care. Digital therapeutics have been developed to treat a wide range of disorders, including substance use disorders (SUD). Developed by the study Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-Investigator (Co-I), LaddrÂ® is a unique mobile platform integrating science-based therapeutic processes to address a wide range of behavioral problems, including SUD.\n\nThe current project expands LaddrÂ® to allow users to engage a support network of their choosing in their journey of behavioral change. Individuals can share data from Laddr about their successes and challenges, and their support network can offer anytime/anywhere social support. Social support will be embedded within a strongly science-based digital therapeutic process - thus providing support persons with a clear framework in which to offer support. Research has shown that engaging a support network of non-substance users (e.g., family members, friends) in one's SUD treatment can greatly enhance treatment outcomes - and is aligned with the \"community reinforcement\" tenet of the CRA treatment model. Interventions that leverage social support networks can help keep individuals engaged in treatment, reinforce their successes, and help them troubleshoot challenges.\n\nThis pragmatic, randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the social version of LaddrÂ® in improving SUD treatment outcomes. Adults entering outpatient SUD treatment at the Farnum Center in Manchester, New Hampshire (NH) will be offered the opportunity to be randomized to 12 weeks of standard treatment (treatment as usual \\[TAU\\] arm), or standard treatment plus the social version of LaddrÂ® (LaddrÂ® arm). The primary study outcome is retention in SUD treatment (time to treatment dropout), and the investigators hypothesize that participants receiving LaddrÂ® will be retained in treatment for a longer duration. Secondary outcomes include participant substance use (self-report and urine toxicology), stages of change, coping skills, recovery capital, and treatment acceptability."

It includes meal planning tools, smart shopping lists, recipes curated by a physician, dietitian and chef educator, daily self-monitoring features with personalized weekly goals, bi-weekly live one-on-one health coaching and support from an online member community, and an educational curriculum. Subjects in the Program may receive support from other members of a Care Team (lifestyle medicine physician, chef educator, registered dietitian and/or psychologist/psychiatrist) as needed. The Care Team does not provide medical advice, nor replace traditional medical care. Instead, the Care Team encourages behavior change by providing support and sharing its expertise.\n\nStudy participants will have access to the Program for a twelve week period and will be asked to complete short health surveys at baseline and at the end of the study."

        "briefSummary": "The primary aim of the project is to test the efficacy of BCBT delivered via a digital platform (i.e., smartphone) to Servicemembers with recent suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts presenting to primary care clinics. Given existing challenges of scaling empirically-supported treatments/interventions for suicidality with fidelity, this project could lead to markedly expanded access to BCBT, along with improving our understanding about what intervention strategies are most effective and how they can be delivered with meaningful fidelity. Aviva, the digital version of BCBT, was developed for use with patients across the full spectrum of healthcare settings, including primary care. Aviva is not an emergency alert system, rather a digital platform for delivery of the full scope of BCBT treatment components. An open-label single group Phase I clinical trial has demonstrated the safety, tolerability, feasibility, fidelity, and potential efficacy of Aviva, with participants completing modules over 8 weeks, and follow-up assessments at weeks 1, 4, and 8. Subsequent refinements included the addition of technical features that would allow patients to revisit and/or repeat previously completed modules, along with integration of more characters for delivering video vignettes and greater opportunities for skills practice and treatment engagement. These modifications have further enhanced Aviva safety, tolerability, and fidelity, consistent with the original BCBT protocol. Not only is it hypothesized that Aviva will result in significantly larger reductions in severity of suicidal ideation than participants randomized to the control condition, but also that greater app engagement will be negatively correlated with severity of suicidal thinking. Moderators and mediators (i.e. suicidal beliefs, wish to live, impulsive decision-making) of intervention effects will also be examined. The study will be conducted at the primary care clinics at Fort Carson, with a goal of enrolling 720 patients across a two-year timeframe. Participants will be identified using each clinic's existing suicide risk assessment methods, including the PHQ-9 suicide risk item and a score of 1 or higher on the CSSRS Screener (Recent). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions, Aviva or control (i.e., development of a safety plan consistent with local procedures and policies, along with referral for standard mental health care and suicide risk management in accordance with local policies and procedures). In an effort to address potential performance bias specific to smartphone use, participants in the control condition will download the Suicide Safety Plan app to their smartphones. Those in the Aviva condition will also complete weekly check-ins with Project 2 research clinicians to review treatment adherence, identify and respond to any logistical/operational problems, and respond to any unexpected emergencies and/or participant safety concerns. Participants will have up to five data points: baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. All data available from all participants and all time points will be included in the analyses, consistent with the intent-to-treat principle. Across our two previous clinical trials and our in-progress RCT, attrition during the first 12 months postbaseline was \\&lt;30% and we anticipate similar rates in this trial.",

The first phase of the program involves engineering goals relating to increasing the battery life of this sensor to 48 hours between charges and reducing the overall form factor size. The second phase of the program is to conduct focus groups with PD patients to assess sensor usability, set up burden, and design feedback. The third phase of the study will assess the feasibility of the sensor to detect and cue swallowing in a small cohort of PD patients."

        "briefSummary": "The principal objective of this application is to improve glycemic control of diabetic patients treated with basal insulin through use of an innovative, FDA-cleared smartphone-based insulin titration application connected to Bluetooth enabled glucose meters. iSage Rx (isageapp.com) allows providers to prescribe basal insulin treatment plans to patients and manages basal insulin doses utilizing clinically proven algorithms. In this pilot study, we hypothesize that this user-friendly application and seamless data capture will improve glycemic control (achieve HgbA1c \\<7%) and reduce the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia. Exploratory measures will include healthcare resource utilization and patient and provider satisfaction. The basal insulin titration algorithms used in iSage have had thousands of user-years' experience in FDA-mandated, closely supervised clinical trials, both for long-acting insulins (e.g., Lantus, Levemir) that have been available for a long time and for the newer ultra-long-acting ones (e.g., Tresiba, Toujeo). However, the effectiveness of iSage with a connected glucose meter has not been studied in a \"real world\" clinical environment. Broad use of such an application and connected devices will, we believe, prove to be cost-effective, favor early and appropriate prescription of insulin, reduce provider effort, shorten time to achieve glycemic goals, and simplify the transition to basal insulin therapy."

Those confirmed as eligible will be scheduled to attend a screening/baseline onsite visit. Eligible participants will be randomized to one of the two groups and will receive instructions on downloading and using the smartphone application to which they were randomized. Participants will use the app as instructed and will attend telehealth visits to complete assessments for the primary and safety endpoints at Weeks 4 and 8 (EOT)."

The knowledge gained will set the stage for a number of future studies related to further elucidating the mechanisms of mindfulness, and the clinical efficacy and utility of this type of training delivered via digital therapeutics in general. Specifically, this study will provide necessary variances for powering larger phase 2 studies."

        "briefSummary": "The goal of this experimental study is to examine the impact of a virtual reality paradigm on heat pain perception in healthy volunteers. The main question it aims to answer is to determine if the virtual reality paradigm reduces pain intensity and unpleasantness evoked by tonic heat pain stimulation. Tonic heat pain stimulation is applied on the left forearm of participants using a Peltier thermode immediately before, during and immediately after virtual reality exposure. Using a with-subject design, participants are sequentially exposed to both the virtual reality condition and an active control condition. The order of administration of the virtual reality and control conditions is randomized.",
        "detailedDescription": "Pain is a complex and multifaced sensory and emotional experience. Virtual reality has shown promise in reducing experimental pain and chronic pain. However, many previous trials in the field lacked proper control conditions. This experimental study examines an immersive virtual environment initially designed for the treatment of endometriosis patients, which demonstrated promising analgesic effects. The current study aims to determine the impact of the virtual reality paradigm on experimental pain perception both during and after virtual reality exposure, while using an active control condition. This study involves healthy individuals with no chronic pain and uses a within-subject design, comparing a virtual reality paradigm with an active control condition. Continuous heat pain stimulation is applied to the left forearm of participants with a Peltier thermode, before, during and immediately after virtual reality exposure. For each continuous heat pain stimulation, pain intensity and unpleasantness are measured using a scale from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain). Using a with-subject design, participants are sequentially exposed to both the virtual reality condition and an active control condition. The order of administration of the virtual reality and control conditions is randomized. Both conditions are administered in a single experimental session at the laboratory."

        "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to begin to test a brain training video game in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).\n\nVisit 1. After informed consent, you will complete a series of questions about your functioning and mood. You will then complete a series of tests (vision, hand tapping, walking). Then, you will complete a set of thinking tests. The first set will be paper and pencil. The second set will be on a tablet or a computer. You will use your study code to sign into these tools and you won't provide any personal details for the digitized tests.\n\nFinally, you will complete the \"cognitive training tool\". There are two versions of this digital, iPad based tool, which takes about 25 minutes to complete and is designed to be entertaining. You will be randomized into 1 of 2 groups: each group will play a version of the brain training game. You will not be told what group/game type you were randomized into. You will be given the tablet with the game on it to take home, and to practice this game 5 times a week for 6 weeks.\n\nVisit 2. After the 6 weeks of at-home training, you will then come back to the research study unit to do a repeat of the initial visit (with physical and cognitive assessments). At this study visit, you will also be returning the iPad.\n\nVisit 3. You will then return 8 weeks after Visit 2, to do a repeat of the assessments.\n\nYou will be compensated for each study visit (visit 1: $50, visit 2: $100, visit 3: $150)."

        "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to compare the advantages and disadvantages of two approaches for quitting smoking among people living with HIV (PWH). Participants will complete a 24- week (\\~6-month) study where the Participants will be assigned to one of two smartphone apps to help with quitting smoking. Regardless of the group participants are assigned to, they will also receive a combination of nicotine replacement therapy (patches and gums) that have been shown to help people quit smoking. The main questions this study aims to answer are:\n\nParticipants will complete 5 video call visits over about 6 months. Participants will install their assigned smoking cessation app onto their phone and will be asked to use the app for the duration of the study along with their provided Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) products. During the study visits, participants will meet with study staff to complete questionnaires and interviews. Participants may be asked to provide breath and saliva samples to measure the level of carbon monoxide and nicotine.",
        "detailedDescription": "Tobacco use has alarmingly high rates among people with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (PWH), 43% compared with 15% in the general population. Due to the development of highly effective treatments for HIV and the resulting increased longevity among PWH, this population now loses more life years to smoking than to HIV infection itself. Novel and effective models to deliver wider reaching smoking cessation interventions for PWH are highly needed and indicated as a priority for National Institute of Health. Digital therapeutics (DTx) may be a novel, scalable, and highly available approach for engaging and treating smoking in this population. However, although DTx for smoking cessation have been shown effective in the general population, no large trial to date has examined the effectiveness of a tailored DTx for smoking cessation in PWH, and no implementation science work has examined barriers and facilitators of implementation of DTx for smoking cessation in this population."

The Untire app helps a patient recognize and learn about daily behaviors, fatigue levels, and energy levels. The Untire app has been tested on all different cancer types globally and has been proven to decrease fatigue and improve overall quality of life but this is the first-time investigators are examining the strengths and weaknesses of using the Untire app as a digital treatment plan for Cancer Related Fatigue.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study interventions including smartphone app use and evaluations with questionnaires and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will be in this research study for up to 12 months.\n\nIt is expected that about 60 people will take part in this research study."

        "briefSummary": "The APPROVE trial is a multi-centered, randomized controlled trial designed to assess differences in symptom improvement, quality of life, bladder symptoms, satisfaction with treatment and continued treatment efficacy in women with overactive bladder (OAB) randomized to a prescription digital therapeutic (PDTx) app called RiSolve compared to standard behavioral education (handouts).",
        "detailedDescription": "In this trial, we will employ a randomized controlled trial design to determine if women with overactive bladder (OAB) treated with the RiSolve prescription digital therapeutic (PDTx) demonstrate greater improvement in OAB-related health as compared to standard behavioral education with informational handouts. RiSolve is a digital therapeutic device intended to provide behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for adult women who have been diagnosed with OAB, which includes urinary urgency with or without urge urinary incontinence (UUI), urinary frequency, nocturia, and mixed incontinence with predominant OAB symptoms. RiSolve is indicated as an 8-week treatment to reduce the symptoms of OAB.\n\nFor the purposes of this trial, the primary outcome to determine improvement in OAB-related health will be defined as achieving the MID (defined as an improvement of 10 points or more) on the OAB-q SF Symptom Severity subscale after 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes will include achieving the MID on the OAB-q SF Health-Related Quality of Life subscale, meeting the patient's acceptable symptoms state (PASS) on the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), and improvements in frequency, nocturia and urge urinary incontinence (UUI) on a 3-day bladder diary and on the ICIQ-FLUTS. Participants will be randomized to either PDTx therapy (active) or standard treatment of behavioral education (control). Participants randomized to control will have the option to crossover to PDTx after the initial 8 weeks of the trial if desired. Participants will continue to be followed and asked about their symptoms at 6 and 12 months.\n\nThe impact of this trial has enormous potential to improve treatment of OAB. The ability to offer behavioral therapy via PDTx will reduce patient burden while simultaneously increasing quality of life for women suffering from OAB and decreasing provider burden. The high-quality data from this study will be used to support a marketing application with the FDA through the De Novo pathway for an accessible, low-burden, efficient intervention to help millions of women currently suffering from this burdensome condition."

        "briefSummary": "The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to test the effectiveness of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) compared with digital patient education about insomnia for people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The main questions it aims to answer are whether dCBT-I is effective in reducing insomnia severity in people with MS, whether dCBT-I is effective in reducing daytime fatigue, psychological distress, cognitive problems, medication use (hypnotic, sedative/anxiolytic and antidepressant), resource utilization and if these changes are mediated by improvements in insomnia severity and whether dCBT-I is feasible for people with MS",
        "detailedDescription": "Insomnia is prevalent among individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Improving sleep is an important therapeutic goal, but there is currently a lack of effective treatment options. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) has been widely studied in other patient groups and is currently recommended as first- line treatment for chronic insomnia.\n\nOverall, the availability of CBT-I has been limited, as the number of patients in need of treatment far exceeds the number of available therapists. Therefore, fully automated digital adaptations of CBT-I (dCBT-I) have been developed that contain both screening and intervention. Whether this treatment is effective for a clinical sample of patients diagnosed with MS, or if improved sleep can lead to improved daytime functioning in MS, is however, currently unknown.\n\nThis is a novel approach to a digital treatment of a common disorder in MS, and that may result in improved implementation of a low-threshold intervention.\n\nUpdate August 28th, 2024\n\nWe aim to increase the target sample size from 260 to 550 to increase the statistical power to detect differences between the intervention group and control group on the secondary outcomes, e.g., fatigue, cognitive functioning, mental health, and movement measures measured with actigraphy. Few treatment options have shown effects on these outcomes for people with MS but are a significant problem for this patient group. Small effects from this trial may have substantial scientific and clinical value and are important to test with adequate statistical power.\n\nBased on previous RCTs investigating the effectiveness of dCBT-I we aim to have a sample size large enough to detect small to moderate effects (Cohen's d = 0.3 til 0.5) on the secondary outcome measures fatigue, cognitive function, mental health and movement measures measured with actigraphy. As the planned RCT involves limited contact between researchers and participants, we have predicted that the study dropout rate will likely reach about 50%. Therefore, we aim to recruit 550 participants, to enable us to retain 275 participants (137 in each treatment arm) at the end of the RCT. For a two-sample t-test with alpha=0.05, this sample size gives a power of 90% of detecting a difference of Cohen's d = 0.40."

        "briefSummary": "Regular, habitual exercise is a critical component of the long-term management of Parkinson disease (PD). However, PD-specific motor (e.g. slow and diminished movements, variable step timing) and non-motor (e.g. depression, apathy) problems collectively hinder physical activity. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) is a rehabilitation technique that employs coupling of auditory cues with movement. Walking with RAS has been shown to benefit walking rhythmicity, quality, and speed. These walking benefits make RAS advantageous in promoting moderate intensity walking activity -- an important health-objective in the management of PD. However, the therapeutic potential of RAS in self-directed walking programs has not been examined. In this pilot, we will utilize a breakthrough digital therapeutic that delivers music-adaptive RAS to alleviate PD-specific problems by regulating stepping patterns. Using music as a substrate for cue delivery, this digital therapeutic leverages gait benefits from RAS along with enjoyment of music listening, thus making it a viable and engaging modality that will yield habits of regular walking. Habits are automatically recurring psychological dispositions that emerge from repeated behaviors. The investigators posit that music cues provide recurring contextual cues that automatically evoke habitual response of exercise, thus has the potential to prompt regular physical activity. This study will enroll 61individuals with mild-to-moderate PD (Run-in: 17; Main Trial: 44). The experimental intervention, \"Amped-PD\", is a 6-week, user-managed community-based walking program that utilizes music-adaptive RAS that progressively increases walking intensities. This study will examine if Amped-PD (Experimental Intervention) is more effective than a standard-of-care walking program (Active-Control Intervention) in improving physical activity based on moderate intensity walking, and in improving motor deficits related to quality of walking in individuals with mild-to-moderate PD. This study will also examine whether the resultant habits formed from each intervention matter in relation to training-related changes in physical activity.",
        "detailedDescription": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the fastest growing source of disability among neurological disorders. Diminished physical activity is highly prevalent in PD and often lead to the onset of disability. Regular, habitual exercise is a critical component of the long-term PD management. However, PD-specific motor (e.g. slow and diminished movements, variable step timing) and non-motor (e.g. depression, apathy) problems collectively hinder physical activity. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) is a rehabilitation technique that employs the coupling of auditory cues with movement. When used during walking, RAS has been shown to benefit walking rhythmicity, quality, and speed. Therefore this rehabilitation technique can be advantageous in promoting moderate intensity walking activity. While clinical studies support RAS-based intervention, its translation to real-world, community-based environments and for long-term exercise for the promotion of physical activity is limited. The difference that determines viability of RAS for out-of-lab applications lie in the distinction between external entrainment (open-loop) versus autonomous entrainment (closed-loop). Open-loop RAS requires high levels of vigilance and is prone to error accumulation, which is problematic with gait dysfunction in PD. On the other hand, closed-loop RAS allows for natural and stable entrainment. A closed-loop approach in this case is a necessity of the task and a technological challenge to translate RAS to community-based settings. In this pilot, the investigators will utilize a breakthrough digital therapeutic that employs closed-loop RAS to alleviate PD-specific problems by regulating stepping patterns. Using music as a substrate for cue delivery, this digital therapeutic leverages gait benefits from RAS along with enjoyment of music listening, thus making it a viable and engaging modality that will yield habits of regular walking. The investigators posit that music that is linked to enjoyment serves as context cues that define the pre-condition to engaging in habitual walking exercise and increased physical activity. With repetition, these recurring contextual triggers (i.e. music) automatically evoke a habitual response of exercise, and thus has the potential to amplify physical activity.\n\nThe main aims of the study seek to examine if Amped-PD (Experimental Intervention) is more effective than a standard-of-care walking program (Active-Control Intervention) in improving physical activity based on moderate intensity walking (Aim 1), and in improving motor deficits related to quality of walking (Aim 2) in individuals with mild-to-moderate PD. Additionally, this study will examine whether habit formation mediates the relationship between the intervention (Amped-PD or Active-Control) and physical activity (Aim 3). The investigators hypothesize that Amped-PD will have greater improvements in amounts of moderate intensity walking and stride-to-stride variability based on stride length and swing time. Further, habit formation will be one mechanism that will explain the link between the intervention and physical activity. Secondary research aims will examine whether Amped-PD is more effective than Active-Control in improving motor and non-motor features based on short- and long-distance walking function, spatiotemporal measures of walking, step activity based on daily step counts, disease severity scores, quality of life, self-efficacy on walking, and depression.\n\nThis study will utilize the breakthrough digital music therapeutic developed and manufactured by MedRhythms (Portland, ME). To examine the effects of the intervention, the investigators will use clinical measures of motor and gait function, participant self-reports on habit formation, and quantified movement data on walking and physical activity using wearable sensors. This study will be implemented by carrying out the following study visits: (1) Primary screen over the phone, (2) Clinical Screening and Baseline Assessment, (3) Community-based, self-directed walking program (6 weeks), (3) Post-training Assessment; (4) Follow-up training (2 weeks), and (5) Final Follow-Up Assessment. Altogether, these procedures may take up to 10 weeks."

        "detailedDescription": "The research project is a single-group observational demonstration study to assess the clinical utility of a digital therapeutic technology (the Affect app) in terms of participant acceptance and the app's ability to enhance retention in the Affect program of services for the treatment of individuals with meth-primary stimulant use disorder (MUD). Measures of reduction and/or cessation of methamphetamine use will be assessed by saliva drug tests at least twice weekly during each participant's 8-week involvement in the program, at end of treatment, and via self-report at follow-up points at 1, 3, and 6 months after completion of the program. The app-based program will involve the same services for study participants as would occur regardless of the research, being a standard of care for MUD. The intervention phase of the study will be completed within approximately four months, with follow-ups of the final participants occurring approximately six months after the end of the intervention phase."

The program incrementally builds skills and beliefs to develop personally meaningful strategies to combat cravings, using such techniques as regular app-promoted deep breathing exercises, daily exercise, and help in making and sticking to a relapse prevention plan. Counseling sessions are arranged via text sent by the Team Care advocate and also presented to the participant via the app as a reminder.

In parallel, several trials demonstrated that widely available social media platforms can be effectively utilized to enhance the effects of standard of care evidence-based smoking cessation treatments. Both approaches capitalize on highly scalable digital technologies, and are therefore likely to have population level impact. Drawing from these two separate programs of research, the central premise of this proposal is that LTQ, a stand-alone smoking cessation app tailored to patients with SMI, can be enhanced with peer-support delivered on social media. Therefore, this proposal seeks to develop and asses the acceptability and feasibility of LTQ-Connect -- the integration of the evidence-based smoking cessation app, LTQ, with social support delivered via social media -- to boost the efficacy and community reach of digital therapeutics tailored for patients with SMI. To achieve this goal, we will:\n\n(1) determine the ideal design requirements of an LTQ-Connect integration among smokers with SMI, and (2) investigate the feasibility of LTQ-Connect in a single group pilot trial. Both interventions will be combined with nicotine replacement therapy, a safe and widely available medication."

This is an augmented reality (AR) mobile phone application that uses Recovery-oriented Cognitive Therapy (CT-R) to target negative symptoms of schizophrenia.\n\nNST-SPARK uses a game AR activity to recapitulate the beginning activation and engagement phase of each CT-R session as per standardized practices for this therapeutic modality.",
        "detailedDescription": "The specific beliefs targeted during each module are queried before engaging in the AR activity to obtain participant buy in. A self-assessment is taken before and then subsequent prompts challenge these beliefs over the course of the activity. After completion of the AR activity the self-assessment is performed again and the results are compared against the pre-activity responses.\n\nThe responses received pre- and then post- activity determine the responses SPARK provides to the participant.\n\nExample: Question: How ambitious or motivated do you feel now?\n\nIf the post activity response shows a higher level of motivation compared to the pre-activity assessment the participant will receive the following: So you felt more motivated and more energized! And you did more work not less! Like the more you do the better you feel.\n\nThe prototype NST-SPARK v.1.5 has 2 modules: 1) SPARK ENERGY and 2) SPARK MOTIVATION, and is an abbreviated experience following the general framework for NST-SPARK."

It contains interactive dialogues that can be accessed via computer or smartphone, illustrations, audio recordings and motivating text messages. Techniques to cope with insomnia symptoms (e.g., psychoeducation about causes and basic emotional needs in addition to relevant strategies to improve sleep quality) are conveyed in interactive sequences that are accompanied by audio recordings, illustrations, and worksheets. Patients are also prompted to regularly complete brief symptom severity self-monitoring questionnaires. Optional daily text messages with motivational content accompany the program. The program can be accessed for 365 days after registration.",

        "briefSummary": "Delirium is a condition of fluctuating confusion and agitation that affects as many as 80% of patients in critical care. Hyperactive delirium consumes a significant amount of clinical attention and resources due to the associated psychomotor agitation. Patients can become aggressive or combative putting both themselves and healthcare workers at risk of harm. Delirium has been linked to an increased risk of death and poor overall outcomes. Management largely relies on the use of potentially toxic medications and physical restraints despite limited proof of success of these interventions. Our research group will study the use of a novel interactive digital therapeutic behavior modification platform aimed at reducing anxiety and agitation associated with hyperactive delirium. We hypothesize that Use of the Mindful Garden behavioral modification platform will result in normalization of agitation and delirium scores when used for the management of delirium associated agitation in the adult delirious acute care population compared to standard care alone.",
        "detailedDescription": "Mindful Garden is a digital behavior modification platform that utilizes screen based delivery systems and sensor technologies. Mindful Garden delivers real 2-dimensional nature video layered with hyper-real 3-dimensional animations of growing and receding flowers and butterflies in flight which aims to reduce anxiety and agitation in the delirious critical care population. In doing so, normalization of agitation and delirium scores may be achieved as well as a reduction in reliance on pharmacological interventions and the use of physical restraints, which have been linked to adverse outcomes and significant side effects.\n\nParticipants with a diagnosis of hyperactive delirium in acute care inpatient units will be randomized to receive 4 hours of exposure to the MG platform in addition to standard care or to the control arm of monitoring with standard care only for the same time period."

The main question it aims to answer is will people with opioid use disorder who receive the study intervention, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement in Virtual Reality (MORE-VR), have fewer days in which they use opioids than will people who just receive their usual treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive 8 weekly sessions of MORE-VR in addition to their usual treatment, or treatment as usual only. Researchers will compare these groups at the end of treatment and three months after treatment is over on number of days of opioid use and time until first opioid use lapse, as well as drug craving and mood.",

Participants will be randomized (1:1) to either 8 weekly sessions of MORE-VR or TAU. Participants will be assessed at intake, post-treatment, and a 3 month post-treatment follow-up. The primary outcome assessed will be days of opioid use."

The current proposal will test the acceptability, initial efficacy, and mechanisms underlying a novel digital therapeutic targeting risk for PTSD-CUD, which could address the critical need for PTSD-CUD prevention for the 100,000 women who annually present for emergency care after sexual assault. In this research context, the applicant will receive key training in multisite, emergency-care based randomized clinical trials (RCTs), advanced statistical analyses for RCTs and ecological momentary assessment data, biobehavioral mechanisms underlying PTSD-CUD prevention, and professional development, launching her independent research career focused on reducing the public health burden of PTSD-CUD among sexual assault survivors by leveraging digital therapeutics."

        "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study was to determine in patients currently being administered antipsychotic pharmacotherapy whether PEAR-004 could further reduce symptoms of schizophrenia as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).\n\nThe overall rationale for the study was to assess the first prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) in schizophrenia using a form of proven psychosocial intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), to supplement standard of care with antipsychotic medications.",
        "detailedDescription": "This was a randomized, sham-controlled, rater-blinded, parallel group trial. Overall, 112 subjects were randomized 1:1 in to the following groups:\n\n* Group A: Clinician-directed pharmacotherapy + PEAR-004\n* Group B: Clinician-directed pharmacotherapy + sham app An up to 28-day screening period included standard screening assessments as defined in the assessment schedule. Eligible subjects were randomized on Day 1 into one of the treatment groups.\n\nSubjects in both groups continued to receive their clinician-directed standard-of-care treatment for schizophrenia, including pharmacotherapy. Subjects in Group A used PEAR 004 and subjects in Group B used a sham for a period of 12 weeks. Subjects returned to the clinic for outpatient visits at Week 4 (day 29), Week 8 (day 57), and Week 12 (day 85). At each visit, standard assessments were performed according to the assessment schedule, including PANSS, ISST-Plus, CGI, BMQ, MAP-SR, WHOQOL-BREF, BDI-II, ISI, and adverse events (AEs). A final follow-up visit was performed at Week 16 (day 115),"

Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life). The mean score of items within each domain is used to calculate the domain score. Each individual item of the WHOQOL-BREF is scored from 1=not at all to 5=completely on a response scale, which is stipulated as a 5-point ordinal scale. The scores are then transformed linearly to a scale of 0 (the worse quality of life) to 100 (the worse quality of life).",

        "detailedDescription": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is defined as having recurrent abdominal pain associated with defecation or a change of bowel habits. The pathophysiology of IBS can be looked through the biopsychosocial model of disease which is defined by the complex interplay between genetic, cultural, environmental, and psychosocial factors.\n\nTreatment of IBS is multifaceted and ranges from exercise to dietary restrictions, however, psychological treatments to target the gut-brain axis such as cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) have also been shown to be an effective therapy, and aims to address the psychological and environmental stressors that contribute to the symptoms. Therefore the purpose of the study is investigate the effectiveness of Zemedy, a mobile application that enables the digital delivery of a CBT program to people with IBS.\n\nCBT has been shown to reduce the severity of intractable IBS symptoms by as much as 70%. The investigators hope to learn whether the Zemedy mobile application is effective in the reduction of IBS. This will be measured based on their IBS Symptom Severity Scores (SSS) at week 8 compared to baseline."

        "briefSummary": "A virtual prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of using the levaÂ® Pelvic Digital Health System (PDHS) to perform PFMT compared to a standard home exercise home program for the treatment of SUI/SMUI. The treatment part of the study lasts eight weeks and has two arms. One group will receive routine care consisting of at-home Kegel exercises, and the other will be provided with a levaÂ® device and instructions for use. Subjects in both groups will be assessed at baseline, then at 4 and 8 weeks for change and improvement of their symptoms. They will also be assessed at 6 and12 months after study completion.",
        "detailedDescription": "This trial is entirely virtual. No office visits, specific locations, or physical examination will be required. Enrollment may occur from any location in the United States\n\n* A virtual prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of using the levaÂ® PDHS to perform PFMT (leva arm) compared to standard care of a PFM exercise home program (Kegel arm) for the treatment of SUI or SMUI.\n* Following completion of e-consent and screening, including an initial bladder diary and introductory phone call to review the study requirements, subjects are considered officially enrolled.\n* A series of baseline assessments will be administered to all subjects to evaluate symptom severity, frequency and impact.\n* Subjects will then be randomized to either the levaÂ® arm or Kegel arm on a 1 to 1 ratio using block randomization. Prior to initiation of the trial, a randomization sequence will be generated by the ObvioHealth system. Participants will be automatically allocated the next available slot in the sequence at the time of their randomization and assigned to the levaÂ® or Kegel group accordingly.\n* Prior to beginning the program, subjects in the Kegel arm will receive printed instructions for PFMT with Kegel exercises. Subjects in the levaÂ® arm will be shipped the levaÂ® digital device, along with instructions for use and how to download the corresponding digital app. Day 1 of the study begins the day following receipt of materials.\n* Study population: women with SUI or SMUI.\n* The study requires no office visits. All participant data will be entered in the subject's smartphone using a custom designed mobile application. Participants will be able to interact with the app throughout the study period and will be presented with surveys and a voiding diary on a specified schedule during an 8-week treatment period. There will also be expected post-intervention follow up surveys at 6- and 12-months\n* Using virtual recruiting, a total of up to 350 subjects will be enrolled in the trial.\n* Subjects in both arms will have three scheduled phone calls with study staff during the first two weeks of treatment.\n* Subjects can speak to the study staff at any time via an in-app chat function, the phone, or videoconference."

Willing participants will complete enrollment procedures (i.e., consent forms and initial survey) during this same, initial SANE care visit.\n\nAll enrolled participants will complete 4/day ecological momentary assessments (EMAs; day 1 through day 49) and complete a follow-up assessment at week 1. More information on EMA and week 1 assessment content is available in the \"Outcome Measurements\" section of this listing.\n\nFollowing their week 1 survey, all participants will be randomized into either the active (RISE Guide) or control (Breathe2Relax app) condition. Participants will receive a link to their assigned intervention. Participants in the active condition will additionally begin receiving ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) at the end of their ecological momentary assessments, which consist of personalized feedback based on symptoms reported during EMAs.\n\nAll participants will receive an Empatica wristband in the mail. Participants will wear the wristband week 1 through week 7 and press a button on the wristband's interface whenever they experience internal (e.g. thought) or external (e.g. seeing the assailant in public) trauma reminders. The wristband will collect continuous data on participants' heart rate, temperature, and perspiration, which will be used as measurements of stress reactivity.\n\nAll participants will complete further follow-up assessments at week 7, month 6, and month 12.\\* More information on each follow-up assessment's content is available in the \"Outcome Measurements\" section of this listing.\n\n\\*The month 12 follow-up assessment was removed via an IRB modification approved on December 14, 2022.

        "briefSummary": "Over 3 million teenagers in the USA have depression, and rates of depression and suicide are sharply increasing. Teenage depression has far-reaching consequences including impairments in academic and work performance and social and family relationships, substance abuse, and worsening of other health conditions, which can persist into adulthood. Access to mental health care for teenagers is limited due to a shortage of mental health providers and many teenagers and parents are reluctant to take antidepressants. COVID-19 and mandated physical and social distancing is expected to increase rates of teenage depression, and further limit access to traditional methods of care (e.g. psychotherapy). This highlights an urgent need to develop accessible, digital treatments for teenage depression to address the serious mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This fully virtual study (https://www.limbix.com/spark) will compare the relative safety, effectiveness, and engagement of a mobile application based on cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral activation (Limbix Spark), focusing on the idea that engaging in behaviors that are rewarding or provide a sense of mastery can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression. Limbix Spark will be compared to a mobile app containing educational material about depression (Psychoeducation).",
        "detailedDescription": "Depression in adolescence is a public health crisis, with incidence and suicide rates rising sharply over the past decade. The COVID-19 global pandemic, along with mandated social and physical distancing, is expected to have substantial repercussions on public mental health and exacerbate the mental health crisis among teens. Adolescents, a group with significant unmet mental health needs, are at risk during this time, as they are especially vulnerable to depression and suicidality following environmental stressors, trauma, and social isolation that are endemic to this global pandemic. With difficulties in receiving in person care magnified during social distancing, now more than ever, there is an immediate need for safe, accessible, and effective digital treatments for mental health disorders.\n\nThe proposed intervention is intended to increase access to mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)- based digital treatment for adolescent depression (Limbix Spark) relative to psychoeducation. Limbix Spark implements behavioral activation (BA), a key CBT skill that provides a sense of pleasure or mastery through self-monitored activities to reduce depressive symptoms and improve functional outcomes.\n\nAdolescents with depression (13-21 years old) across the country will be recruited to participate in a fully remote, clinical trial via https://www.limbix.com/spark. At an initial virtual visit, following informed consent, adolescents and parents (for those under 18) will fill out standardized questionnaires designed to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general health. Participants will then download an app onto their mobile phone and be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will receive the Limbix Spark program and the other will receive the Psychoeducation program for 5 weeks. The Limbix Spark program is divided into 5 levels. Each level provides educational information about cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral activation, and interactive activities including mood tracking and activity scheduling. The Psychoeducation program is divided into 5 lessons. Each lesson covers a different topic about depression. During both 5 week programs, patients will also complete a weekly Patient Health Questionnaire, which is designed to measure depressive symptoms and also will report any negative side effects they may be experiencing. After 5 weeks, participants and legal guardians (for those under 18) will complete another set of standardized questionnaires designed to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general health. Patients will also complete questionnaires asking them about their thoughts and experiences with the program they just completed. Lastly, a subset of patients and parents will be invited to complete a virtual interview to provide feedback on using the program.\n\nThe trial will be divided into two phases. The first phase will enroll 60 participants and participants will be randomized to either Spark and Control groups as described above. The second phase will enroll 175 participants and those randomized into the control group will be given access to the 5-week Spark intervention after completing the 5 weeks of control condition (control extension arm). Once completing the control extension arm, participants will complete a second set of post study questionnaires after 5 weeks.\n\nAll study participants that complete the 5-week Limbix Spark program and the post study questionnaires will be contacted and asked to consent to participation in the follow-up study. Only participants who did not opt-out to being contacted for future research will be contacted. This study will collect questionnaires from participants at any or all of the following time frames as indicated: 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month following completion of the Spark arm."

        "briefSummary": "Medical ethics encourages medical personal to actively care for patients, however old they may be, if they have maintained their physical autonomy and mental integrity to travel the path of medical care together. Many of the patients are in this situation today and their age does not seem to be a limiting factor in the care required.\n\nFor more than 60 years, antithrombotics have played a major role in the management of thromboembolic and arterioatheromatous diseases. the doctors have therefore seen the advent of low molecular weight heparins, new platelet antiaggregants and then direct oral anticoagulants.\n\nIf their contribution is no longer discussed today, it is necessary to take into consideration the risks they cause, particularly in terms of haemorrhage. Indeed, antithrombotics are the leading cause of serious adverse reactions in France with anti-vitamins K (AVK) which are the leading cause of hospitalization for severe iatrogeny in France. This risk is increased by the coexistence of haemorrhagic risk factors: drug interaction, misuse, failure to comply with contraindications and precautions for use, especially as exposure to these drugs increases with age.",
        "detailedDescription": "The risk of bleeding varies in different populations and according to the treatment used. Severe bleeding under AVK has an incidence of 0.6 to 10% per year. Fatal hemorrhage is in the order of 1%. The risk factors for bleeding are controversial: history of bleeding in the patient, instability of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) at the time of introduction of KVAs and during the first few months, poor patient compliance, drug combinations (antiplatelet, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: NSAIDs, paracetamol, etc.) or association with alcohol. National pharmacovigilance data indicate that serious accidents are not uncommon due to frequent misuse of antithrombotics in common practice.\n\nThere are risk factors related to the patient and his or her comorbidities: history of bleeding, stroke, comorbidities such as age \\> 65 years, diabetes, cancer, chronic renal failure.\n\nDespite the various aids to therapeutic patient education (surveillance logbook, computerised INR monitoring), there has been no decrease in the frequency of iatrogenic accidents, either in hospitals or in urban medicine.\n\nThe use of smartphone applications in the medical field is increasingly evolving among healthcare professionals and patients. They allow for more personalized care, and can also promote interaction with health professionals.\n\nStrengthening the link between specialist doctors and the general practitioner for joint patient management will improve their follow-up and reduce the risk of iatrogeny.\n\nIn 2016, a survey was conducted in the vascular medicine department of the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph (GHPSJ) to assess access to smartphones among patients on anti-thrombotic medication. Of the 100 patients enrolled, 74 were on anticoagulant or platelet aggregation therapy. Of these, 50 had a mobile phone and 24% used the Internet and made downloads to their phones.\n\nThis raises the question of the interest that patients might have in a mobile application on the use of anti-thrombotics. As the profile of patients seen in hospital is different from those consulting in general medicine, it seems interesting to study these two populations in order to know if there is a difference in their attitude towards the smartphone.\n\nIn order to find a new way to limit the iatrogeny of antithrombotic drugs, the investigators wanted to set up a medical application (educational tablet) for patients to provide them with support to better manage their treatment."

Individuals with elevated symptoms of depression will use the digital intervention over the course of 4 weeks. They will complete a brief (\\~5 question) survey daily, as well as weekly assessments.",
        "detailedDescription": "This study aims to assess the feasibility and efficacy of the digital therapeutic attention bias modification (ABM) intervention that targets and reduces negative attention bias among adults with elevated symptoms of depression. Consistent with the experimental therapeutics approach ABM has been shown to both reduce negative attention bias and improve symptoms of depression. However, engagement with these tasks have been mixed, with some participants describing traditional ABM tasks as boring. This had led to the development of gamified versions of ABM with the intent to improve participant engagement. Nevertheless, there have been very few rigorous trials of ABM for depression, and no one to our knowledge has used ecological momentary assessment to tease apart the mechanisms by which ABM can lead to improvements in depression symptoms.\n\nParticipants will access the intervention on their mobile smart phone and complete treatment over a period of 4 weeks. Enrolled participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Gamified attention bias modification training, or gamified placebo training. They will complete brief (\\~5 questions) daily surveys, as well as weekly remote assessments of attention bias and depression symptoms."

        "briefSummary": "This study will provide measures of safety and efficacy of the NightWare digital therapeutic system (iPhone + Apple watch + proprietary application) for the treatment of nightmare disorder associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related sleep disturbance and the impact of improved sleep with the NightWare digital therapeutic system. The investigators hypothesize that the NightWare digital therapeutic system will significantly improve sleep quality in participants with PTSD-Related nightmares and poor sleep quality.",
        "detailedDescription": "Nightmares are a common problem affecting 2-8% of the general population and a higher proportion of clinical populations. The negative consequences of untreated nightmares are significant and include impaired quality of life, sleep deprivation (often resulting in an increased intensity of nightmares), insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue. Untreated nightmares can also exacerbate the symptoms of underlying psychological dysfunction in people with depression and anxiety, leading to poor occupational and or social functioning. Nightmares can be idiopathic or associated with the use (or withdrawal) of certain medications or substances or associated with disorders including PTSD.\n\nNightWare (Minneapolis, MN) has developed a novel approach to the treatment of nightmares. Through the use of a smartwatch-based application that senses physiologic parameters, the participant is aroused from sleep (without awakening the participant) so that the nightmare is interrupted prior to reaching a threshold of severity in which the participant would awaken in distress. Seconds later the participant returns to sleep without having experienced a nightmare. This approach avoids risk from pharmacological treatment, avoids exacerbation of symptoms from image rehearsal therapy and allows for a simple method with easily achieved adherence compared to existing treatments.\n\nThe NightWare digital therapeutic system consists of a proprietary software application installed on a smartwatch. The application has been effective in focus groups when used on both Apple smartwatches and Motorola smartwatches. For the purposes of this study, the investigators will be using only the Apple (Cupertino, CA) 3rd generation smartwatch and the Apple iPhone. The NightWare application uses physiological markers obtained via the smartwatch to determine by proprietary algorithm whether a participant is in the early stages of a nightmare, but has not yet awoken in distress. As directed by the algorithm, the smartwatch then applies varying degrees of vibratory stimulation to the wrist over variable lengths of time with the intention of arousing the participant from sleep without eliciting an awakening."

Nineteen individual items generate seven \"component\" scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. This outcome is the difference between the global score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score at baseline (Day 0) and average global PSQI score across the post-treatment initiation assessments (Days 14, 28 and every 28 days after that).",

This digital platform provides daily contact with the user to maximize compliance. It allows a provider to administer behavioral modification treatment while minimizing in-office visits.\n\nThe investigators expect that a proportion of participants using Cece will experience significant and satisfactory improvement in their voiding symptoms, to the point where no further treatment is necessary. Others will require additional treatment with the usual therapies such physical therapy and medications, per clinical standards.\n\nParticipants will download CeCe to their smart phones and interact with the program for 8 weeks. Participant consent and specific instructions will be provided during study enrollment and through the app. Study outcomes are collected through the program via in-app questionnaires and voiding diaries.\n\nA total of 50 participants will be recruited. They will be compensated a total sum of $175; $50 at completion of an initial set of questionnaires, $50 at completion of 4 week follow-up questionnaires, and $75 at completion of 8 week follow-up."

Approximately five-hundred (500) adults with type 2 diabetes will be randomized (1:1) to BT-001 or the control application. Most clinical data will be collected via the electronic medical records (EMR) system with limited additional contacts to ascertain adverse device effects (ADEs), adverse events (AEs) and clinical events which may have occurred outside the health system and were not recorded in the EMR. For primary efficacy endpoint assessment, a requisition form for HbA1c at a local laboratory will be provided if HbA1c is not available from the EMR within the 90- and 180-day time windows. During the extension phase, biomarker endpoint data will only be collected from the EMR. For all participants, clinical and healthcare utilization data will be extracted from their EMR for the period from 180 days prior to enrollment to 720 days after enrollment."

This study aims to see if using cognitive behavioral therapy aimed at military service members in an online self administered platform is effective therapy in the relief of migraines compared. The study will use a single blind online comparative program to test the effect.",
        "detailedDescription": "The AMMO digital therapeutic (DTx) will be a novel intervention for PTH following concussive TBI, therefore this project is a pilot trial designed to test this new treatment. This pilot is a single-blind, randomized, controlled, interventional trial of current and former military personnel along with civilians with a history of concussive TBI and current PTH. The pilot trial will be conducted via online portal accessible by smartphone, tablet, or computer with remote interaction between participants and study staff. The pilot trial will include up to 100 participants randomized to either the active intervention or a comparison condition at a 1:1 ratio, and will provide preliminary data to determine the sample size of a future full clinical trial. Participants will complete a 12 week intervention period followed by a follow-up assessment 4 weeks after intervention is complete. Participants randomized to the comparison group will be provided access to the open label after end of 16 week follow-up.\n\nIn addition, updates to the DTx to improve usability and acceptability will be made if necessary based on feedback from the pilot trial, then applied to the final DTx used in a future, larger, clinical trial."

        "briefSummary": "This study will provide preliminary estimates of safety and efficacy of the NightWare digital therapeutic system (iPhone + Apple watch + proprietary application) for the treatment of nightmare disorder associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related sleep disturbance and the impact of improved sleep with the NightWare digital therapeutic system. The investigators hypothesize that the NightWare digital therapeutic system will significantly improve sleep quality in participants with PTSD-Related nightmares and poor sleep quality.",
        "detailedDescription": "Nightmares are a common problem affecting 2-8% of the general population and a higher proportion of clinical populations. The negative consequences of untreated nightmares are significant and include impaired quality of life, sleep deprivation (often resulting in an increased intensity of nightmares), insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue. Untreated nightmares can also exacerbate the symptoms of underlying psychological dysfunction in people with depression and anxiety, leading to poor occupational and or social functioning. Nightmares can be idiopathic or associated with the use (or withdrawal) of certain medications or substances, or associated with disorders including PTSD.\n\nNightWare (Minneapolis, MN) has developed a novel approach to the treatment of nightmares. Through the use of a smartwatch-based application that senses physiologic parameters, the participant is aroused from sleep (without awakening the participant) so that the nightmare is interrupted prior to reaching a threshold of severity in which the participant would awaken in distress. Seconds later the participant returns to sleep without having experienced a nightmare. This approach avoids risk from pharmacological treatment, avoids exacerbation of symptoms from image rehearsal therapy and allows for a simple method with easily achieved adherence compared to existing treatments.\n\nThe NightWare digital therapeutic system consists of a proprietary software application installed on a smartwatch. The application has been effective in focus groups when used on both Apple smartwatches and Motorola smartwatches. For the purposes of this study, the investigators will be using only the Apple (Cupertino, CA) 3rd generation smartwatch and the Apple iPhone. The NightWare application uses physiological markers obtained via the smartwatch to determine by proprietary algorithm whether a participant is in the early stages of a nightmare, but has not yet awoken in distress. As directed by the algorithm, the smartwatch then applies varying degrees of vibratory stimulation to the wrist over variable lengths of time with the intention of arousing the participant from sleep without eliciting an awakening."

Nineteen individual items generate seven \"component\" scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. This outcome is the difference between the global score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score at baseline (Day 0) and average global PSQI score across the four post-treatment initiation assessments (Days 14, 30, 44 and 60).",

        "detailedDescription": "Nightmares are a common problem affecting 2-8% of the general population and a higher proportion of clinical populations. The negative consequences of untreated nightmares are significant and include impaired quality of life, sleep deprivation (often resulting in an increased intensity of nightmares), insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue. Untreated nightmares can also exacerbate the symptoms of underlying psychological dysfunction in people with depression and anxiety, leading to poor occupational and or social functioning. Nightmares can be idiopathic or associated with the use (or withdrawal) of certain medications or substances or associated with disorders including PTSD.\n\nNightWare (Minneapolis, MN) has developed a novel approach to the treatment of nightmares. Through the use of a smartwatch-based application that senses physiologic parameters, the participant is aroused from sleep (without awakening the participant) so that the nightmare is interrupted prior to reaching a threshold of severity in which the participant would awaken in distress. Seconds later the participant returns to sleep without having experienced a nightmare. This approach avoids risk from pharmacological treatment, avoids exacerbation of symptoms from image rehearsal therapy and allows for a simple method with easily achieved adherence compared to existing treatments.\n\nThe NightWare digital therapeutic system consists of a proprietary software application installed on a smartwatch. The application has been effective in focus groups when used on both Apple smartwatches and Motorola smartwatches. For the purposes of this study, the investigators will be using only the Apple (Cupertino, CA) 3rd generation smartwatch and the Apple iPhone. The NightWare application uses physiological markers obtained via the smartwatch to determine by proprietary algorithm whether a participant is in the early stages of a nightmare, but has not yet awoken in distress. As directed by the algorithm, the smartwatch then applies varying degrees of vibratory stimulation to the wrist over variable lengths of time with the intention of arousing the participant from sleep without eliciting an awakening."

Nineteen individual items generate seven \"component\" scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. This outcome is the difference between the global score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score at baseline (Day 0) and average global PSQI score across the post-treatment initiation assessments (Days 14, 28 and every 28 days after that).",

Nineteen individual items generate seven \"component\" scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. This outcome is the difference between the global score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score at baseline (Day 0) and average global PSQI score across the four post-treatment initiation assessments (Days 14, 30, 44 and 60).",

Study enrollment will last for 3 months after discharge from the acute care setting. Participants in the reSET-O+TAU group will be provided with the reSET-O app and will be encouraged to engage with the app for the 3 months following discharge from the acute care unit. The app works as an extension of cognitive behavioral therapy, providing psychoeducation related to opioid use disorder.

        "briefSummary": "This single-center, controlled, and randomized study evaluates the effectiveness of the Phonix Care app in regulating screen use among young people aged 11 to 25. Faced with high and often concerning levels of screen consumption among youth, this research aims to provide an innovative intervention method beyond current psychotherapeutic and pharmacological approaches, which are often limited by the risk of relapse and the difficulty in delaying the short-term rewards offered by screen activities \\[1, 2, 3\\]. Phonix Care is designed to encourage awareness and self-regulation of screen use, thus promoting more responsible and autonomous behavior.\n\nThe primary outcome measure is based on a problematic screen use score derived from the Digital Addiction Scale. Secondary objectives include examining the effects of the app on screen consumption, physical health, mental health, and motivation towards studies, measured through a series of questionnaires and objective evaluations.\n\nThe study is conducted on 138 subjects, divided into two groups: an experimental group and a control group, over a participation period of six months. Statistical analyses will include descriptive analyses, multiple linear regression, and mediation models to assess the impact of Phonix Care.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include significant contributions to the scientific literature regarding screen use among youth, as well as advances in adolescent and young adult health and psychology. In practice, the evaluation of Phonix Care could lead to the development of an effective medical device to quantify and treat problematic screen use, offering a complementary therapy to existing methods to prevent or remedy this issue.\n\n1.

Documentation and Archiving:\n\n    * Upon study completion, all study documentation will be archived for future reference and audit purposes.\n    * Archiving procedures will adhere to regulatory guidelines and institutional policies.\n\nSample size assessment: To evaluate the effectiveness of Phonix Care using the overall score from the Digital Addiction Scale by Hawi et al. (2019), with an average Cohen's effect size d= 0.30 to 0.40 and a standard deviation of 19.25 (mean= 56.3), here are the necessary sample sizes for different statistical powers (1-Î²), with a significance level of Î±= 0.05:\n\n80% power: from 96 to 174 participants required. 85% power: from 110 to 200 participants required. 90% power: from 129 to 233 participants required.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlan for missing data: We conduct an analysis of the missing data mechanism according to the rules set by Little and Rubin. Although it is very rare, if we validate the hypothesis that the missing data are completely random (Missing Completely At Random), we conduct the analyses using the incomplete data set. This data set will not bias the estimates. The most likely case is the validation of the Missing At Random hypothesis, which suggests that the missing data are due to one or more factors in our possession (e.g., experimental condition, threshold of problematic use), we proceed with multiple imputations before conducting our analyses. To determine if certain factors can explain whether the data are missing or not, we use logistic regression analyses via the GLM package on R Studio version 4.0.2. In the case of multiple imputations, we use the MICE package on R Studio version 4.0.2.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStatistical analysis plan: We first proceed with the descriptive analysis of screen usage profiles and the number of profiles observed in our sample. We expect to observe at least three usage profiles: moderate, intensive, and problematic. To do this, we use the K-means clustering method. Next, the variables measured by questionnaire undergo longitudinal confirmatory factor analyses to ensure that, despite experimentation, we observe some longitudinal invariance of the measurement constructs (i.e., weak invariance). For our primary research objective, we conduct analyses using multiple linear regression. By controlling for certain factors that may have an effect on problematic screen usage (e.g., gender, age), we evaluate the simple effects of digital addiction scores before the study and the assignment group, and then the interaction effect between this addiction score and the assignment group on digital addiction scores at the end of the study. To address our secondary objectives, we conduct multiple linear regression and mediation analyses for each of the secondary objective variables as dependent variables in linear regressions and as mediation variables."

The study will include a screening visit and a randomization visit, followed by 24 weeks of study treatment. Subjects will be scheduled for evaluation visits, which will include a UDS and a self report of drug use, weekly during the first four weeks of treatment, then every other week from weeks 5 through 12, then monthly through week 25. Subjects will also return to the site for only a urine drug screen (UDS) and a self-report of drug use each week between the evaluation visits.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to determine whether the combination of sublingual (SL) buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NAL) standard of care (SOC) background therapy and the digital therapeutic OXD01 is superior to SL BUP/NAL alone to reduce opioid use.",
        "detailedDescription": "Medication-assisted treatment, the current standard for opioid addiction, is the use of medications in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies to provide a \"whole-patient\" approach to the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). However, patients may not have optimal access to faceto-face clinical behavioral health services. Digital therapeutics can help bridge the gap between accessible services and optimal treatment of OUD, the primary goal of which is to reduce the use of opioids. OXD01 is a device-based digital therapeutic, designed to offer individuals diagnosed with OUD quality psychotherapy intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing. This study is being conducted to determine the value of OXD01 when combined with medication to change opioid use patterns in subjects with OUD.\n\nNote: No investigational product will be administered as part of this study."

        "briefSummary": "The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a digital therapeutic (EndeavorOTCÂ®, also known as AKL-T01A) on clinical symptoms of executive and cognitive functioning in a real-world sample of university students. This study aims to answer whether EndeavorOTC represents a useful intervention for targeting broad cognitive and emotional health among university students.",
        "detailedDescription": "University students face an increased risk of mental health challenges, as well as elevated stress due to the demands of managing coursework and social stress during a formative developmental period with increased independence. Consequently, there is a need for scalable, evidence-based interventions that can help university students manage their cognitive and emotional health. Through a partnership between Akili Interactive Labs and participating colleges, free 12-week access to AKL-T01 will be provided to any student interested in treatment for the duration of an academic semester, up to an N of 500 per site. This study will evaluate changes in participants across a range of clinical and functional outcomes, including cognitive functioning, academic outcomes, social functioning, attention and associated symptoms, and quality of life. The study will also evaluate user feedback and information on the usability of AKL-T01 through both quantitative and qualitative methods."

Surveys conducted after app installation (Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7), and a sleep environment questionnaire) will serve as the baseline.\n\nDuring the clinical trial period, sleep diaries and compliance (lesson completion rate) (applicable only to the experimental group) will be collected through the app. Sleep diaries will be used to evaluate sleep metrics such as sleep efficiency (SE), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), etc.\n\nFor the experimental group, assessments as per the protocol will be conducted at baseline (Visit 1), and safety (adverse events) evaluation and termination of app usage will occur at 9 weeks (Visit 2)."

        "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether NightWare therapeutic intervention improves biomarkers of vascular aging and autonomic function in adults with nightmares related to PTSD.",
        "detailedDescription": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is linked to accelerated aging and is associated with increased risk of early-onset cardiovascular disease (CVD) in both men and women. The pathophysiological link between PTSD and CVD is complex and multi-factorial that likely involves premature vascular aging (i.e., large elastic arterial stiffening and vascular endothelial dysfunction) and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., reduced cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity \\[cBRS\\] and heart rate variability \\[HRV\\]), along with other mechanisms. Vascular aging and autonomic dysfunction are key antecedents in the development of CVD and individuals with PTSD have greater arterial stiffening, endothelial dysfunction and reductions in cBRS and HRV compared to those without PTSD. The mechanisms by which PTSD contributes to greater vascular and autonomic dysfunction are not completely understood. Sleep is important for cellular and tissue repair, free radical detoxification and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Sleep disturbance is a hallmark symptom of PTSD and is associated with biomarkers of vascular aging, autonomic dysfunction and increased risk of CVD. Nightmares, a central feature of PTSD associated-sleep disturbance, are a debilitating symptom that can lead to insomnia or sleep deprivation, daytime sleepiness or fatigue, mood disturbances, cognitive impairments, behavioral problems, or other sequela, that ultimately causes clinically significant distress and impairment in social, occupational and physiological function, as well as increased CVD risk. As such, therapeutic strategies and interventions aimed at reducing nightmare-associated sleep disturbances in individuals with PTSD are clinically important for improving sleep quality, cardiovascular health and risk for future age-associated CVD.\n\nVarious psychotherapeutic (e.g., imagery rehearsal therapy \\[IRT\\]) and pharmacological (e.g., prazosin) interventions are available for treatment of nightmares associated with PTSD. However, the evidence for their efficacy for addressing sleep disturbances is inconsistent, particularly with pharmaceuticals, and implementation barriers and poor adherence exist with psychotherapy. As such, novel alternative approaches, including the use of digital medicine such as app-based and digital platforms are being developed to improve treatment delivery. NightWareâ„¢ digital therapeutic system is one such novel platform that was recently granted Breakthrough Device designation by the FDA for the treatment of nightmares in adults with PTSD. NightWare uses a proprietary application on the Apple WatchÂ® to collect biometric data (i.e., heart rate \\[HR\\] and body movement) to learn sleep patterns to create a stress Index. When an individual exceeds this index due to entering a nightmare, NightWare intervenes by sending vibrotactile feedback to the Apple Watch, arousing the individual and interrupting the nightmare without waking or disrupting sleep. Through machine learning, NightWare continually refines its model and knowledge of the person's response, consequently leading to fewer nightmare associated awakenings. In unpublished preliminary studies, NightWare was shown to be safe (no change in suicide risk or daytime sleepiness) and a tendency to have greater improvement in objective measures of sleep quality (i.e., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index \\[PSQI\\] and amendment for PTSD \\[PSQI-A\\]) compared to sham (NightWare but intervention disabled, i.e., no vibration). Whether NightWare improves cardiovascular health in adults with PTSD-related nightmares has yet to be studied.\n\nAccordingly, the investigators are proposing a randomized, double-blind, placebo (i.e., sham intervention) controlled parallel pilot study that will provide the first clinical evidence for the efficacy of the NightWare digital therapeutic system to improve cardiovascular health outcomes in adults with PTSD-related nightmares."

        "detailedDescription": "Tinnitus, characterized by the perception of sound without external stimuli, affects approximately 14% of the global population, posing a significant public health concern. This predominantly subjective condition often leads to psychological and physical distress, including anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Current approaches to managing tinnitus include pharmacological interventions, sound therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Among these, CBT is recognized as one of the most effective methods for addressing the psychological distress associated with tinnitus. However, traditional CBT often faces accessibility barriers, such as the need for frequent in-person sessions and high costs. This limits its reach and effectiveness for many patients.Digital therapeutics, particularly mobile applications, offer promising solutions by providing scalable and accessible interventions. These platforms allow patients to engage in therapy conveniently, accessing real-time, personalized content. Despite advancements in digital therapeutics, research on combining CBT and sound therapy for tinnitus remains limited. This gap in research highlights the need for innovative, accessible treatments that can be tailored to individual patient needs.\n\nThis study aims to address this gap by evaluating the clinical efficacy of a mobile application that delivers personalized CBT and sound stimulation. The application, designed to provide tailored interventions, will be compared to conventional CBT methods. By leveraging the strengths of both CBT and sound therapy, this study seeks to contribute to the development of more accessible and effective tinnitus treatment options.\n\nThe study will employ a prospective, multicenter, randomized, single-blind (participant), parallel-design, superiority, confirmatory trial to assess the efficacy and safety of the mobile application. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group using the mobile application or the control group receiving conventional CBT educational materials. The primary outcome will be the change in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) scores from baseline to 6 weeks, with secondary outcomes including changes in THI subscales, Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for negative emotions and tinnitus discomfort, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).\n\nThe study's design and methodology are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the mobile application. By using a randomized controlled trial design, the study ensures that any observed effects can be attributed to the intervention rather than external factors. The use of standardized assessment tools like THI and TFI will provide a comprehensive understanding of the application's impact on tinnitus-related distress.\n\nFurthermore, the study will assess the safety and tolerability of the mobile application, monitoring for any adverse events or side effects. This is essential for ensuring that the treatment is not only effective but also safe for widespread use."

        "briefSummary": "This Phase II Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project is a clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness random controlled trial (RCT) of DynamiCare Health's innovative smartphone/smart debit card remote digital coaching program, which integrates Contingency Management, Recovery Coaching, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), to address alcohol use disorder (AUD) in 300 adults.",
        "detailedDescription": "This application proposes to continue clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness testing of the DynamiCare Health platform. This is an innovative smartphone-based digital coaching program that offers remotely-delivered contingency management (CM), Recovery Coaching, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) content to address alcohol use disorder (AUD). CM, which uses financial incentives to reward abstinence and treatment attendance, is one of the most effective, evidence-based, and overlooked intervention for substance use disorders (SUD). DynamiCare, through its remote delivery system, has addressed the logistical barriers to adoption, and now seeks, through this proposal, to drive payer adoption. Our Phase 1 preliminary data shows that the intervention is acceptable and can be highly effective when delivered as a supplemental therapy to persons with AUD enrolled in treatment. Phase 2 proposes to partner with Medicaid to deploy and test the fully developed intervention in an RCT among individuals with AUD (n=300). Our goals are to: 1) Deploy the DynamiCare CM and digital coaching program at scale among Medicaid members with AUD; 2) determine clinical effectiveness; and 3) evaluate the cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment from the payer perspective. This study design addresses a lack in the CM literature of empirical evidence on the cost-savings for payers from CM. If CM can be shown to create cost-savings for payers, the final barrier to widespread adoption would fall. Overall, this Phase 2 project, which follows a highly successful Phase 1, will provide critical data to advance the utility of this innovative digital platform as it is deployed in the real world to help the millions of people with AUD."

Have consumed at least one alcoholic beverage within the last 10 days, according to self-report\n4. Speak English\n5. Have an Android or iOS smartphone.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participants with current suicidal intent will be excluded as they require a higher level of care that cannot be provided by DynamiCare and our Recovery Coaches (hence, these individuals will be directly referred for clinical evaluation).\n2. Participants with ASAM CO-Triage level needs higher than Level 3.1 (e.g., greater than community-based, working halfway house) and not receiving addiction treatment will be excluded because they require inpatient treatment.

        "briefSummary": "Worries about harm from others (also known as paranoia) are common. Thinking fast or going on gut feelings is natural but can fuel these worries. For some, fast thinking and worries start to get in the way of life. Cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is the recommended talking therapy. However, only a minority of people can access CBTp due to limited resources, and even when available, therapy can be difficult to do and use in daily life.\n\nSloMo is a digitally supported therapy that aims to overcome these barriers, and was developed by people with psychosis, designers, and psychologists. It supports people to notice worries and fast thinking habits. During therapy sessions, people learn to slow down and feel safer. Personalised spinning thought bubbles are slowed down using SloMo tips. An app provides access to helpful messages.\n\nSloMo was previously tested in a randomised trial of 361 people attending mental health services. SloMo was found to be safe to use, with no adverse events linked to the software. People in the SloMo group had lower paranoia, and better confidence and wellbeing, over 6 months compared to people who just received their usual care. People found SloMo enjoyable and easy to use.\n\nThe next step is to evaluate if SloMo can be safely and effectively delivered by therapists working in NHS services. If SloMo works in routine care, the therapy will be made more widely available in the NHS.\n\nAn improved version of SloMo has been co-produced based on feedback. Sixty therapists will be trained and supervised in 3 trusts to deliver SloMo to 150 people who fear harm from others. Safety, technical performance, uptake, engagement and acceptability data, alongside interviews with patients, therapists, and managers, will investigate how SloMo is used. Paranoia severity and wellbeing will be measured pre and post therapy to find out if SloMo helps. Service use data will evaluate costs and savings.",
        "detailedDescription": "DESIGN AND AIMS The study is a repeated measures design, with clinical outcome assessments pre- and post-delivery of SloMoR2, and a 6-month follow-up for health economics data collection. The aim is to evaluate if SloMo is implementable and effective when delivered in routine care by therapists working in NHS routine services. Delivery with high and low intensity therapists will be evaluated, with the former holding doctorate or diploma therapy qualifications, and the latter representing graduate psychologists or the NHS's expanding workforce of psychological practitioners. Outcomes will be evaluated using questionnaires, software analytics, and medical record data (for demographics, adverse events, and service use). Interviews will be conducted with a subgroup of relevant stakeholders to understand their experiences of SloMo.\n\nThe project will be conducted in 3 NHS trusts. Each trust will have a local study team, funded by the research grant and directly employed by local services, to support training, supervision, and implementation. Design research has already been conducted in preparation for the study to support the co-production of an improved version of SloMo tailored for implementation (SloMoR2). The study will run for 24 months and consists of four stages:\n\n1. Site set-up (month 1-3) Site set-up will be conducted to pilot the training, supervision, and technical support procedures that will ensure SloMoR2's performance, data protection and clinical safety.\n\n2a. Process evaluation: Implementation (month 4 - 21) A mixed-method process evaluation will be co-produced to understand how SloMoR2 is experienced, including safety, engagement, adherence, acceptability, fidelity \\& usability, and to identify barriers and enablers to implementation.\n\n2ba. Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (month 4 - 21) An evaluation will be conducted to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SloMoR2 when delivered in routine care.\n\n3. Analysis, resource development and dissemination (month 22 - 24) Findings will be summarised in consultation with our LEAP group. They will be written up in a plain English summary and as articles for submission to peer-review publications. Experiences of therapy delivery will inform any further refinements to the SloMoR2 software. Findings will also be used to support the co-design of an automated e-learning programme for therapists and develop a commercialisation strategy to assist being scaled up in the NHS.\n\nSAMPLE AND RECRUITMENT Service user recruitment: The recruitment target is to deliver SloMo to 150 service user participants (across Stage 1 and 2) who are: Aged â‰¥18 years, meet criteria for ICD-10 psychosis diagnoses (F20-29, F30-39), seeking therapy for paranoia, in contact with secondary care mental health services, and capable of providing informed consent to engage in therapy. People will be excluded if they: are at acute risk of harm to self or others, are unable to engage in therapy due to language barriers, and have a primary diagnosis of alcohol/substance dependence, learning disability, or organic brain injury or illness implicated in psychosis.\n\nTherapist recruitment, training, and supervision: In Stage 1, an initial cohort of therapists ('high intensity'; n = 5 per trust) will be selected from senior clinicians experienced in delivery and supervision of CBT for psychosis. Therapists will be required to complete a 1-day training. They will subsequently be able to access on-demand clinical and technical supervision from their local study team as required to support SloMoR2 delivery. In Stage 2, a further 45 'high' and 'low' intensity therapists will be trained across the 3 sites. This will be based on a 'training the trainers' model. The initial cohort of five trained high intensity therapists from Stage 1 will support training and supervision of an additional 15 therapists per site. Training will be extended to 3 days for low intensity therapists. The local study team will liaise with local services to promote SloMo2 and support trainers to roll out training to other high and low intensity therapists.\n\nStakeholder recruitment: The experience of SloMo's delivery will be evaluated using subgroups of the therapist and participant samples recruited in Stages 1 and 2 (N = 60, and N = 150, respectively). This will involve interviewing subgroups of service users (n = 20) and therapists (n = 6) involved in SloMo's delivery, as well as senior managers (n = 5) and payers (stakeholders involved in the commissioning of mental health services; n = 5), about their experience of SloMo. The service users will be recruited by the local study team. They will approach participants who consented to be contacted about further SloMo studies, once the participant has disengaged (therapist defined) or completed therapy. The four samples will be recruited to ensure a diverse range with respect to age, ethnicity, gender, site, and professional background (for staff interviews). All potential participants will be provided with a participant information sheet and given the opportunity to ask questions before signing the consent form.\n\nPROCEDURE The local study team will initially conduct PPI consultation with their trust therapy workforce to scope readiness for adoption of SloMoR2. This work will identify implementation barriers and facilitators, to enable tailoring of implementation resources and strategies to site needs.\n\nTrained therapists will identify potential participants and offer them SloMo, based on their clinical judgement. Following an initial introduction, participants will provide informed consent to receive SloMo and for their data to be collected for research purposes, with an optional opt-in for contact about further SloMo research. The burden of the informed consent process will be minimised where possible. This has been done by embedding the participant information sheet and consent form at the beginning of the SloMo webapp ('therapy platform'). Therapists will review this with potential participants and address any questions they have. Data storage and strategies for data protection will be emphasised, based on PPI feedback that this is a key area of concern. It will also be emphasised that service users will be free to withdraw their consent to engage in therapy at any time or to request that their data be deleted from the SloMo software or omitted from the research analysis.\n\nIf willing to proceed, participants' consent will be provided by indicating consent on the form. Participants will not sign the consent form with their name, to minimise the personally identifiable information stored in the software. Therapists will countersign and date the consent form. A copy of the countersigned consent form will be posted or sent electronically to the participant by the local SloMo team.\n\nPre and post therapy measures will be collected through the SloMo therapy platform at the first (R-GPTS (part B), short WEMWBS), second (GBO) and last therapy session (all). Sessional measures will be taken at each session. The local study team will extract demographic, adverse event, and service use data from participants' medical record.\n\nINTERVENTION SloMoR2 consists of up to 11 digitally supported therapy platform modules targeting paranoia and a mobile app for use outside of sessions. Therapy will be delivered according to the SloMo manual instructions for use. The therapy helps people learn to slow down for a moment to find ways of feeling safer and living well. Animated stories and interactive tasks support participants to learn how to apply SloMo tips to manage their worries, with in-session content synchronised to the mobile app which provides out of session support.\n\nOUTCOMES\n\n1a) Implementation To address the primary research question, is SloMoR2 implementable in routine care, quantitative data will be gathered for the following primary outcomes: i) safety, measured by frequency of any unanticipated serious therapy and/or device-related adverse events, and ii) service user engagement, measured by the proportion of participants who are delivered 5 or more SloMo sessions ('minimum therapeutic dose'). In addition, data will be gathered for the following secondary outcomes: i) service user engagement, measured by the number of individuals who begin (1 or more sessions) and complete therapy (8 or more sessions, 'full course' as three modules are optional), ii) therapist uptake, measured by the percentage of therapists that receive SloMo R2 training who commence therapy with at least one participant, iii) adherence, measured by percentage completion of sessions started, iv) usage, service user usage of mobile app, v) acceptability, measured by the percentage of positive responses on the NHS Family and Friends Test, vi) fidelity, competence of therapy delivery (with a random selection of 10 sessions per site assessed by the local study lead), vii) stakeholder experience of implementation, based on qualitative interviews with service users, therapists, senior managers, and payers, and viii) usability, measured by the User Experience Survey (UES; Service user and therapist). The qualitative interviews exploring user experience in participants who have been offered SloMo will be lived experience researcher-led. The qualitative interviews with therapists will explore experiences of training and delivery of SloMoR2 in more detail. Finally, senior managers and payers, who have and have not been involved in implementing SloMo, will be interviewed to understand their perspective on SloMo and its scale-up. All interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. Participants will be reimbursed for their time according to INVOLVE guidelines.\n\n1b) Effectiveness To address the primary research question, is SloMoR2 effective for paranoia and wellbeing when delivered in routine care, participants will complete (via the SloMo therapy platform) three brief questionnaires at the beginning and end of therapy. The primary effectiveness outcome measure is the persecution subscale (part B) of the Revised Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale (RGPTS-B). Secondary effectiveness outcome measures are the short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) and the Goal Based Outcome. Sessional measures will be collected during therapy sessions to monitor progress, using four scales (rated from 0 - 100) of paranoia distress, fast and slow thinking, safety beliefs and confidence.\n\n1b) Cost-effectiveness To address the primary research question, is SloMoR2 cost-effective when delivered in routine care, costs and savings will be evaluated by the local study team extracting mental health service use data from participant medical records using the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI), and QALYs derived from an algorithm applied to the Revised Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale, persecution subscale (part B) (RGPTS-B). Mental health service use data will cover the 6-month period prior to the intervention, the period during the intervention, and the 6-month period following its end. This analysis will also incorporate the service use data collected for the SlowMoR1 trial as this will provide additional data to enhance the health economic modelling."

        "briefSummary": "Preventing pre-surgical stress can help patients achieve positive outcomes on health and well-being. However, very few patients receive adequate stress relief support prior to a surgical procedure. Provision of education and information about the surgery can be a crucial component of the preoperative experience and is inversely related to levels of preoperative anxiety. However, resource constraints make face-to-face education sessions untenable, given cost considerations and time investment by trained health personnel. Interventions based on mobile health (mHealth) technologies, geared towards increasing familiarity with surgical procedures and hospital environments have been shown to help patients feel informed about possible benefits and risks of available treatment options. mHealth apps and Virtual Reality (VR) can offer patients experience in the perioperative environment that can be helpful in empowering patients and enhancing a more positive experience, while reducing stress. However, available applications focus only on providing informative content, neglecting the importance of patient empowerment with a more robust educational curriculum.\n\nAccording to this, the Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) CARINAE, aims to support patients and caregivers during the whole perioperative process. SaMD CARINAE consists of an mHealth mobile application for patients and caregivers, a Virtual Reality headset for patients, and a web application for healthcare professionals.",
        "detailedDescription": "Patients will be randomly assigned to intervention group or the control group. Intervention group will be exposed to the use of SaMD CARINAE for 2 months approximately. The intervention trial will include a total of 4 visits: 1. Recruitment; 2. Hospital admission; 3. Hospital discharge; 4. Post-operative follow-up in 14 days.\n\nSaMD CARINAE delivers the following interventions to the patients:\n\n* Personalised patient-centred health education program to improve patient's condition and recovery self-management skills.\n* Artificial Intelligence-based behaviour change program to promote healthier lifestyle habits.\n* Personalised mental well-being coaching program to improve patient's ability to cope with emotional disturbances such as stress and anxiety.\n* A collaborative digital support platform to enable information exchange between patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.\n\nThe program is delivered to patients and caregivers as a SaMD mHealth application (smartphone app) and an immersive environment with a VR device. Healthcare professionals will be able to access the collaborative digital support platform through a web application.\n\nFinally, the control group will not be exposed to SaMD CARINAE solution, following the traditional routine visits, and after each traditional visit patients will answer to questionnaires specified in the secondary outcome measures section."

It consists of 13 items that have four possible response options ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (4) strongly agree, and an additional \"not applicable\" option. To calculate the total score, the raw score is divided by the number of items answered (excepting non-applicable items) and multiplied by 13. Then, this score is transformed to a scale with a theoretical range 0-100, based on calibration tables, with higher scores indicating higher patient activation. The raw scores can be converted into four activation levels: 1 (â‰¤47.0) not believing activation important, 2 (47.1-55.1) a lack of knowledge and confidence to take action, 3 (55.2-67.0) beginning to take action and 4 (â‰¥67.1) taking action.",

        "briefSummary": "The study aims to determine the effect of core stability exercise through using fully immersive virtual reality in postpartum female with lumbopelvic pain.\n\nThis study will be randomized clinical -trial and will be conducted at Shalamar Institute of health sciences in 1 year after the approval by institutional review board. Sixty female participants with a history of lumbopelvic pain will be recruited on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data will be collected after taking written Informed Consent from each patient. The included participants will be randomized by gold fish randomization method and allocated to two groups (A \\& B) each with 30 participants.",
        "detailedDescription": "Lumbopelvic pain refers to self-reported pain in the lower back, sacroiliac joints, or a combination of these locations, among pregnant and postnatal women. Approximately 50% of pregnant women report lumbopelvic pain to some degree. Recent studies indicate the importance of hip extensors, pelvic floor muscle (PFM) and transverse abdominal muscle (TrAM) in the development of lumbopelvic pain.Moreover, pelvic instability, asymmetry and insufficient compression of the sacroiliac joints contribute to continuous lumbopelvic pain after delivery. In Europe every tenth women shortly postpartum and every sixth has reported similar symptoms 6 weeks later. Age, PGP during pregnancy and abdominal midline doming were associated with experiencing PGP shortly postpartum.\n\nStudies have demonstrated the importance of choosing an optimal treatment strategy in clinical practice, and 5 subgroups of self-rated pain locations have been identified in the pelvic area. The study focused on pelvic girdle pain (PGP), or PGP in combination with lumbar pain, since these groups have been shown to have the highest impact on activity levels and health-related quality of life.\n\nStabilization exercises that include dynamically controlling the lumbar segments and pelvic joints have been shown to result in functional improvement in patients with lumbopelvic pain. The term \"core stability\" is commonly used to refer to the ability of these \"core\" muscles to stabilize the lumbar spine and pelvic girdle during static postures and dynamic movements. A host of theories and \"stabilization exercise\" programs have been developed to train these muscles as a means of treating and/or preventing lower back pain (LBP). However, there is still much inconsistency and debate both in the clinical and research communities with regards to what constitutes \"core stability\" and a \"stabilization exercise\". Chronic pain is a global healthcare burden with as much as of 11% of the US population suffering from pain lasting six months or longer, and upwards of 20% in Europe. Chronic pain can lead to depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and impairment in cognitive tasks.\n\nEstablished research supports VR(virtual relaity) as a treatment strategy for burn pain, acute pain, and experimentally induced pain. Two primary approaches afford analgesic benefits of VR: distraction therapy and immersive-ness. Distraction therapy temporarily takes attention away from pain while patients are engaged in the VR experience. In immersive VR, the user can interact with an artificial environment to treat chronic pain. In immersive VR, the user can interact with an artificial environment to treat chronic pain. One form of immersive VR is virtual embodiment. Virtual embodiment refers to the sense of owning a virtual body, from a first-person perspective, feeling the agent of the sensory feedback related to the actions of the virtual body. Through activation of somatosensory and premotor circuitry associated with the body parts that are embodied, the use of virtual embodiment as an immersive VR technique has been shown to influence pain-free range of motion in patients with unilateral chronic shoulder pain.\n\nA case series was conducted in 2020, in which they describe two case studies that use embodiment in virtual reality as a treatment for chronic low back pain. The purpose of this case series was to determine the feasibility of a novel virtual reality-based digital therapeutic for the treatment of chronic pain. Two patients with chronic low back pain received seven sessions, two sessions per week, of a novel digital therapeutic that combines virtual embodiment with graded motor imagery to deliver functional rehabilitation exercises using an off-the-shelf virtual reality system. Pain catastrophizing scale was assessed before the first session and after the seventh session to determine the extent to which virtual embodiment training can improve psychological symptoms of chronic low back pain. In both patients, pain intensity was improved after individual sessions of virtual embodiment training. They concluded that embodiment in virtual reality improves symptoms of persistent chronic low back pain.\n\nA study (RCT) was conducted in 2022 and their study have measured the Effects of a motor control exercise program on lumbopelvic pain recurrences and intensity in pregnant women with a history of lumbopelvic pain. Forty pregnant women with a history of lower back pelvic pain (LBPP) were recruited and randomly allocated to a control (20 participants) or intervention (20 participants) group. The control group have received standard prenatal care, including basic information on what to do when suffering from LBPP. The intervention group have participated in three 40-min exercise sessions per week from \\< 20 weeks until 34-36 weeks of gestation: one supervised group session via the Zoom platform (once a month) and two unsupervised sessions at home. A motor control exercise program was developed to target strengthening of the lumbo-pelvic-hip core muscles and to improve spinal and pelvic stabilization. Participants of this group have also received standard prenatal care. They concluded that motor control exercise program have allowed pregnant women to progress at their own pace through different levels of exercises. In addition, the use of technology in the follow-up of the women will make the approach flexible and adapted to their daily routines.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to reduce the potential abuse, dependency of painkillers and manual therapy intervention for treating chronic lumbopelvic pain. In order to promote an advance and noninvasive method for treating lumbopelvic pain in postpartum female this study will help to design better rehabilitative program including core stability exercise using the analgesic and distracting effects of Immersive Virtual reality. This study will help physiotherapist as well as other health care professionals to treat other factors contributing to lumbopelvic pain other than weak muscles and posture alignment in postpartum female through virtual reality."

Pregnancy-related hormonal changes, characterized by an increase in relaxin, estrogen and progesterone levels, are potentially linked to hyperlaxity of ligament and joint instability, thus contributing to lumbopelvic pain. In addition, biomechanical changes induced by the growing fetus, can modify posture, load sharing and mechanical stress in the lumbar and pelvic structures.

DiNaMo components target key neural systems (including but not limited to systems related to sensory-, perceptual-, affective-, pain-, attention-, cognitive control, social- and self-processing) to optimally improve a participant's health.\n\nTargeted cognitive training is used to reduce symptoms relevant to multiple sclerosis (MS) and cancer. Biases to direct attention towards or away from certain stimuli can exacerbate a variety of symptoms in many different indications. For example, in chronic pain conditions, patients are more attentive to pain-related stimuli, which can lead to hypersensitization. Similarly, hypersensitivity to threat-related stimuli can exacerbate anxiety.\n\nIn this treatment, users are trained to re-orient attention away from negative stimuli, such as pain- or threat-related stimuli."

The DIGITS Trial is a partnership between Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle, and Kaiser Permanente Washington, a healthcare delivery system in Washington State.\n\nIn this study, the FDA-authorized reSET and reSET-O digital therapeutics will be implemented in Kaiser Permanente Washington primary care clinics. The study will evaluate the extent to which two implementation strategy interventions, health coaching and practice coaching, improve the implementation. Primary care clinics are randomized to receive these implementation strategy interventions. Each clinic will have a 12-month active implementation period beginning on its date of randomization. To study the continued use of reSET and reSET-O after the active implementation period is completed, a sustainment period of up 12 months will follow the active implementation period.",
        "detailedDescription": "Specific Aims of the DIGITS Trial are to:\n\n1. Estimate the effect of practice facilitation and health coaching implementation strategies in increasing the reach and fidelity of a digital therapeutic for substance use disorders in primary care clinics.\n2. Compare the population-level cost-effectiveness of each implementation strategy in increasing reach, fidelity, and abstinence."

In this pilot study, the FDA-authorized reSET and reSET-O digital therapeutics will be implemented in 2 primary care clinics as part of quality improvement. The pilot is comprised of a 3-month period in which a standard approach to implementing reSET and reSET-O is applied in the two primary care clinics \"standard implementation\", followed by a second 3-month period in which the study will test and refine the two experimental implementation strategy interventions, health coaching (patient-facing) and practice coaching (clinician-facing) in the same clinics. This study will also pilot economic data collection tools and collect qualitative data for a formative evaluation. The analytic goals are to inform the statistical design and data collection processes for the subsequent cluster-randomized DIGITS Trial."

The QDS collects drinking data for three variables including number of days drinking, number of standard drinks per drinking day, and number of binge/risky drinking days. Binge/risky drinking days is defined as days when they have had 5 or more standard drinks (for men) or 4 or more standard drinks (for women). Number of standard drinks per week is calculated by multiplying number of standard drinks per day in the past month and number of binge days per month.",

        "briefSummary": "The CirrhoCare trial is a multi-centre, open label randomised controlled trial in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The trial aims to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of CirrhoCare digital home monitoring and management with current standard of care in these patients.",
        "detailedDescription": "Cirrhosis, progressive scaring of the liver- has many causes, principally, excessive alcohol intake, fatty-liver and viral infections. Unlike many chronic diseases, cirrhosis deaths are increasing rapidly year-on-year. It is the third commonest cause of premature, UK working-age deaths, with 62,000 years of working-life lost each year and NHS care costs of Â£4.53bn annually. One quarter of all UK cirrhosis patients are at-risk of acute decompensation, whereby complications such as fluid-overload, confusion and infections arise, requiring hospital-emergency treatment.\n\nCurrently, decompensated cirrhosis patients require regular hospital clinical assessments to detect these new complications. Even following hospital discharge, readmission with new decompensating complications approaches 37% in 4 weeks. This disease burden, compounded by increasing alcohol and obesity-driven liver disease, means demand for specialist liver services outweighs current capacity in a resource-stretched healthcare system. Moreover, regional variation of specialist liver services also impacts on illness and deaths, leading to a postcode lottery of care access and geographical inequity.\n\nThe CirrhoCare trial, addresses this urgent clinical-need through an innovative cirrhosis management system, including home-monitoring of decompensated cirrhosis patients, measuring vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure (using low cost, sensing technology), assessing weight (smart-scale) and mental ability (smartphone app), all of which are impacted as cirrhosis progresses. By efficiently and securely collecting data on CyberLiver's management-system (platform), CirrhoCare provides a decision-facilitating tool, incorporating individual-patient data, helping liver-physicians to optimise and personalise treatment in the community.\n\nThe CirrhoCare trial investigators also plan to assess clinical and cost effectiveness of CirrhoCare management and seek regulatory approvals. This innovative aspect of cirrhosis management will be more acceptable and convenient for patients. It will also deliver community care with environmental, sustainable benefits, through reduced hospital visits, despite increasing service demands. The cost- effectiveness analysis will generate value-for-money evidence of CirrhoCare management, and the clinical evidence needed to inform future adoption into the NHS."

        "briefSummary": "Introduction: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a prevalent syndrome that lacks curative treatment, imposing high healthcare and societal costs. The SMART-FM-Spain study investigates the effectiveness, physiological effects, and cost-utility of a self-guided digital intervention (STANZA-Spain) based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for patients with FM.\n\nMethodology: Six-month, 3-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) A total of 360 adult individuals meeting the 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for FM will be recruited mainly at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital (Barcelona, Spain), and will be randomly allocated to one of the three study arms: Treatment as usual (TAU) plus STANZA-Spain, TAU plus digital symptom tracking (FibroST), or TAU. Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 6 month-follow-up. The primary outcome will be functional impairment and secondary outcomes will include patient impression of change, depression-anxiety-stress, and pain catastrophizing, among others constructs relevant to FM. Effectiveness and cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective will be computed, whereas ACT-related constructs, such as psychological flexibility, will be assessed to identify processes of change that will be analyzed with path analyses. Biomarkers will be assessed at baseline and post-treatment including hair cortisol, cortisone, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol in plasma, genotyping of FKBP5 gene polymorphisms, immune-inflammatory markers, and vitamin D levels.\n\nDiscussion: This study might represent a significant advancement in the management of FM in Spanish-speaking patients with FM, by examining the effectiveness, physiological effects, and cost-utility of a smartphone-based digital therapeutic with demonstrated empirical support in the United States of America.",
        "detailedDescription": "Main goals of the SMART-FM-SP study The main objectives of this RCT are: To analyze the effectiveness of adding Acceptance and Commitment Therapy via app (STANZA) compared to an active control arm (Fibro Symptom Tracker app -FibroST-) to the treatment as usual (TAU) for patients diagnosed of fibromyalgia; To examine the cost-utility of STANZA from healthcare and societal perspectives; To measure a set of biomarkers alongide the RCT in order to know the physiological underpinnings of the digital intervention STANZA and to identify potential predictors of treatment response.\n\nSmart-FM-SP is a 6-months RCT with three arms: TAU, TAU+STANZA and TAU+FibroST. Therefore, patients in three arms will receive TAU, and FibroACT and FibroST will be complementary treatments to the standard one provided in the public Catalan Health System."

The app delivers ACT in 15- to 20-minute daily doses over the course of 12 weeks without the involvement of healthcare providers. The program consists of interactive educational materials that teach ACT skills which are reinforced experientially via values exploration and identification, mindfulness, and relaxation exercises. Values-based assignments follow each lesson to assist patients in incorporating ACT skills into their daily lives. Uniquely, STANZA teaches additional skills, including self-guided physical exercise and pacing daily activities via a personally customized stepwise, gradual approach.",

These items inquire about various aspects such as pain, energy levels, stiffness, sleep quality, depression, memory problems, anxiety, sensitivity to touch, balance issues, and heightened sensitivity to noises, lights, smells, or temperatures. The total FIQR score is calculated by summing the scores of the three subscales, resulting in a range of 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate a greater level of impairment.
