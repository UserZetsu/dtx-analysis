## Digital Therapeutics using AI, ML or DL techniques [WIP]


### Data

In the data folder, you will see [ctg-studies-mldl.json](data/ctg-studies-mldl.json), which contains 1026 clinical trial studies from [ClinicalTrials.gov](clinicaltrials.gov), as of May 13th 2025, using 27 search terms to capture digital therapeutics taken from a [systematic reivew](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(23)00244-3/fulltext) by Miao et al., 2024 and 32 search terms I have created to capture machine and deep learning implementation.
